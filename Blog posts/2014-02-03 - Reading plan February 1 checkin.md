This is my February 1 checkin following my [Books I plan to read in 2014][reading-plan] post.

January was a short month as I posted my resolution on January 20 only.

The good news is that I have finished [The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the
Thirteenth Century][perrot] by Jean Perrot. This has kept me busy (or in the back of my head) for about 4 months! I have
pretty complete [reading notes][perrot-notes].

While technically "reading the book" is done, I would like to write a synthesis of what I have learned.

So my goals for February are:

- write that synthesis
- pick the next book to read and start in February

I am shooting for 10 serious reading days this month, for a total of 5 hours.
