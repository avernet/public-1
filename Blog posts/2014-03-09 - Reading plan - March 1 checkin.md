At [last month's checkin](http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/02/reading-plan-february-1-checkin.html), I had the following goals:

- complete my quick synthesis of the organ book
- pick the next book to read and start in February
- spend about 5 hours in total

I failed on all counts:

- I did work on the synthesis but I did not complete it.
- I didn't pick and start the next book.
- I spent a total of  about 1 1/2 hour,

So far this month I haven't done any progress at all, and 2/3 of the month are left. Let's plan to do only 3 quality hours of reading, with the same goals as last month otherwise. This time I am scheduling the reading time in advance.
