My [goal for the month of July](http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/07/reading-plan-july-checkin.html) was:

- continue on the synthesis and try to have a closure on it, spending about 2 more hours

I didn't have any goals for August.

I only managed to spend another hour in July, and I don't have a closure. So I have decided to park this work for a while.

The good news is that I have just started reading [*Daniel Dennett's Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking*](http://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/1491518871) this month, one of the books on my [reading plan for 2014](http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/01/books-i-plan-to-read-in-2014.html).

I have decided to read this book not in digital format, but on good old paper. I have also decided to allow myself to trash this book with highlights and annotations as I see fit.

My goal for the rest of the month is simply to make progress reading this book.
