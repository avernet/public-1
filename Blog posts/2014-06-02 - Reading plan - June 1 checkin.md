My [goals for the month of May](http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/04/reading-plan-may-1-checkin.html) were:

- 3 quality hours of reading
- complete synthesis of the organ book
- pick the next book to read and start

I did manage to do a bit more than 3 hours of planned reading, so that's a success! Now "reading" is a bit of a misnomer because all of this time was spent working on the synthesis. But that was not enough to complete it, so the success is only partial.

Surely, 3 more hours in June should allow me to complete the synthesis this time? Ok, that's the plan.
