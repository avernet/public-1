At the beginning of October, I [wrote](http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/october-reading-resolution.html) about my reading resolution for that month. So, how did I do?

First, the numbers:

- I hit 16 reading days out of 31.
- I read on average 10 pages each reading day.
- I read 170 out of about 300 pages.
- To read 10 pages well and take notes, I needed 30-40 minutes, rarely less.

The bad:

- I didn't manage to read every day. I quickly figured out that it was almost impossible to read on the weekends, but even considering only weekdays, I still fell short with 16 out of 23 weekdays.
- I didn't reach 10 pages per day on average, which would have allowed me to finish the book. This is not surprising, as I would have had to read about double the number of page per reading day, given the reduction in reading days.

The good:

- I did make great progress.
- I have [reading notes](https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Reading/2013-10%20-%20The%20Organ.md) on github.
- I learned about my effective "slow reading" speed.
- I plan to continue this in November, with the differences that I will plan to read only on weekdays. I still plan to average 10 pages per reading day and to take notes. The plan is to finish the book by the end of November. Let's see how that goes!

*Update: It turns out I have to return the book to the library on November 7 as I can only extend it once. I ordered a used copy but that will arrive only in about a week if all goes well. So that will induce some delay.*
