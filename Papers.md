This list was started 2014-07-11.

I like reading research papers, mostly computer science papers. Here is a list of papers I have recently read (but not necessarily fully understood!).

- 2015-05-13: [Diet Soda Intake Is Associated with Long-Term Increases in Waist Circumference in a Biethnic Cohort of Older Adults: The San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/jgs.13376/asset/jgs13376.pdf?v=1&t=i9ohqsq1&s=7a97ce557e6f68e8de264dbb2867d2a9d4c32220)
- 2014-07-08: [Combining Form and Function - Static Types for JQuery Programs (2013?)](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/paper.pdf)
- 2014-05-07: [High-Latency, Low-Bandwidth Windowing in the Jupiter Collaboration System (1995)](http://lively-kernel.org/repository/webwerkstatt/!svn/bc/15693/projects/Collaboration/paper/Jupiter.pdf)
  - About [Operational Transformation (OT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation), the inspiration for Google Wave.
- 2014-04-24: [Why Functional Programming Matters (1984)](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)
- 2014-04-08: Pause ’n’ Play: Formalizing Asynchronous C♯ (2012)
  - The async/await construct is being implemented in many programming languages: Scala, JavaScript, Dart. C# did it first, and I was curious to read what the original designers had to say about it. This paper is about formalizing async/await mainly, but there is a good section about the history of the idea, referred to by @headinthebox.
- 2014-03-05: [Dynamic Code Evolution for Java (2010)](http://ssw.jku.at/Research/Papers/Wuerthinger10a/Wuerthinger10a.pdf)
- 2014-02-09: [Document Restoration Using 3D Shape (1998)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~brown/pdf/iccv01_brown.pdf)
  - I was interested in seeing whether there were algorithm to properly deskew scans. I still haven't found something reasonable.
- 2014-01-22: [When Intentions go Public (2009)](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf)
- 2014-01-08: [On Proof and Progress in Mathematics (1993)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236v1.pdf)
