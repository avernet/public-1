# Papers and articles I have read

This list was started 2014-07-11.

I like reading research papers, mostly computer science papers. Here is a list of papers I have recently read (but not necessarily fully understood!).

- 2016-03-17: [Evening use of light-emitting eReaders negatively affects sleep, circadian timing, and next-morning alertness](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/12/18/1418490112.full.pdf)
    - Half of the participants used a very bright, light-emitting screen, for 4 hours during bedtime.
    - The other half used printed books and a dim light.
    - There were only 12 participants.
    - For screen users, there was a large measured effect on melatonin, sleep was delayed 10 mn, and they were much sleepier in the morning.
    - It would be interesting to compare with:
        - less bright LCD screens with warmer colors (night/readin modes)
        - e-ink readers like the Kindle Voyage with built-in light
- 2015-08-10: [Climate-driven introduction of the Black Death and successive plague reintroductions into Europe](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/10/3020.full.pdf)
    - I stumbled upon this as I was interested in the idea that the Black Death which ravaged Europe during the 14th century was also the cause of the fall of the Mongols in China.
    - This article doesn't address that topic. Instead, it addresses the idea that the plague was introduced multiple times in Europe from Asia during the course of about four centuries.
- 2015-08-06: [Analysis of a Tidal Barrage at the Golden Gate (2007)](http://www.bcdc.ca.gov/pdf/planning/Golden_Gate_Dam_Report.pdf)
    - As a Foster City resident, I am particularly interested in  the impact and solutions to rising ocean levels.
    - This article rejects the idea that a large tidal barrage for the entire Bay Area would be an economical solution.
    - However, the article was commissioned by the government and seems to be skeptical from the get-go that a barrage would be a solution.
    - Still, I tend to agree (based on very little evidence), one reason being that building levies is probably much cheaper as well as less likely to have unintended consequences.
- 2015-05-13: [Diet Soda Intake Is Associated with Long-Term Increases in Waist Circumference in a Biethnic Cohort of Older Adults: The San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/jgs.13376/asset/jgs13376.pdf?v=1&t=i9ohqsq1&s=7a97ce557e6f68e8de264dbb2867d2a9d4c32220)
    - "384 FU1 participants whose DSI had been ascertained at baseline"
    - "DS users […] had higher education levels and were more likely to live in the suburbs and be European American and less likely to smoke or live in lower-income barrios."
    - "DS users also had significantly higher baseline BMI than nonusers and tended to have larger WC"
    - "Baseline prevalence of overweight or obesity […] was significantly higher […] in occasional […] and daily […] DS users than in nonusers"
    - "Although they consumed no regular sodas, daily DS users consumed significantly more total sodas daily (1.54) than occasional DS users (0.38) or nonusers (0.34)."
    - "For men, after age 65, BMI rose slowly, peaked by age 75, and then declined rapidly; by contrast, WC increased steadily beyond age 65 and plateaued by age 80. Divergence between BMI and WC trajectories was even more striking for women"
    - "This divergence is consistent with previous reports of increasing visceral adiposity, with declining muscle mass, in advancing age."
    - "By contrast, WC gains occurred in all DSI categories but were dramatically higher for DS users than nonusers, despite adjustment for initial WC, age, diabetes mellitus status, leisure-time physical activity, smoking status, demo- graphic factors, and follow-up length."
    - "interval DWC of daily users was nearly four times that of nonusers […]. This would translate into cumulative adjusted DWCs of 0.80 inches for nonusers, 1.83 inches for occasional users, and 3.16 inches for daily users over the total SALSA follow-up."
    - "By contrast, no consistent relationship was observed between regular soda use and mean DWC"
    - "aged 65 and older at baseline, a striking, positive dose-response relationship was observed between initial DSI and subsequent long-term increases in WC over a mean total follow-up of almost a decade."
    - "mean interval WC gain in all DS users—including daily and occasional users—was almost three times that of nonusers"
    - "obese users had the worst outcomes in the current study"
    - "The current results suggest one potential pathway — greater abdominal adiposity — through which daily DS consumption might be linked to the greater cardiometabolic risk observed in some of these studies."
    - "Over the past 20 years, abdominal adiposity has been prospectively associated with greater risk of an array of adverse health outcomes"
    - "for these older DS users, greater abdominal girth is of particular concern because it is associated with disproportionately greater visceral fat"
    - "In some studies, abdominal adiposity has outperformed BMI in identifying older individuals at greater cardiometabolic risk"
    - "For this reason, dietary counseling for older individuals would ideally include the promotion of unsweetened coffee and tea, mineral water — unsweetened or lightly sweetened with 100% fruit juice — or simply water as alternatives to highly sweetened beverages."
    - "the degree to which younger individuals would experience the same results is unknown. Whether DSI exacerbated the WC gains observed in SALSA participants is unclear"
    - "other factors — including family history and perceived personal weight-gain and health-risk trajectories — that increased DWC but were not captured in the analyses may have influenced participant decisions to use DS"
    - "across all intervals, approximately 80% of daily DS users at the beginning of the interval remained DS users at the outset of the next follow-up period, and 82% of nonusers at the outset of each follow-up period remained nonusers at the outset of the subsequent follow- up period"
- 2014-07-08: [Combining Form and Function - Static Types for JQuery Programs (2013?)](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/paper.pdf)
- 2014-05-07: [High-Latency, Low-Bandwidth Windowing in the Jupiter Collaboration System (1995)](http://lively-kernel.org/repository/webwerkstatt/!svn/bc/15693/projects/Collaboration/paper/Jupiter.pdf)
    - About [Operational Transformation (OT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation), the inspiration for Google Wave.
- 2014-04-24: [Why Functional Programming Matters (1984)](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)
- 2014-04-08: Pause ’n’ Play: Formalizing Asynchronous C♯ (2012)
    - The async/await construct is being implemented in many programming languages: Scala, JavaScript, Dart. C# did it first, and I was curious to read what the original designers had to say about it. This paper is about formalizing async/await mainly, but there is a good section about the history of the idea, referred to by @headinthebox.
- 2014-03-05: [Dynamic Code Evolution for Java (2010)](http://ssw.jku.at/Research/Papers/Wuerthinger10a/Wuerthinger10a.pdf)
    - The authors of the paper came up with quite interesting solutions to dynamically reload code in the JVM.
    - I think that the team was hired by Oracle years ago, and it is very frustrating that to this day, hone of this seems to have made it to the standard JVM.
- 2014-02-09: [Document Restoration Using 3D Shape (1998)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~brown/pdf/iccv01_brown.pdf)
    - I was interested in seeing whether there were algorithm to properly deskew scans. I still haven't found something reasonable.
- 2014-01-22: [When Intentions go Public (2009)](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf)
    - The main idea of this paper is that if you go public with your plans, you are less likely to go through with them.
    - I read the article in order to understand better how it reaches these conclusions.
    - I came out of it as skeptical as I was initially, because the sample of people surveyed is very small, the study is very narrow, and the effect is small. In my view, this barely qualify as science, and we should be careful not to extrapolate the results.
    - If anything, this study should encourage further, more serious studies.
- 2014-01-08: [On Proof and Progress in Mathematics (1993)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236v1.pdf)
