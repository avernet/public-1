- 2016-09-18: [Umberto Eco - Baudolino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudolino) #paper #french
    - bought probably more than 10 years ago
    - started reading during my summer vacation
- 2016-07-03: [Iain M. Banks - Use of Weapons](https://www.amazon.com/Use-Weapons-Culture-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B0015DWLTE) #ebook

- 2016-05-07: [Iain M. Banks - The Player of Games (A Culture Novel Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/Player-Games-Culture-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B002WM3HC2) #ebook
    - I devoured this book, especially the last part!
    - I am probably not the only one to be introduced to this book  by SpaceX's use of *Just Read the Instructions* and *Of Course I Still Love You*.
    - [highlights](Reading/2016-05-07%20-%20The%20Player%20of%20Games%20(A%20Culture%20Novel%20Book%202)%20(Iain%20M.%20Banks).md)
- 2016-03-30: [Umberto Eco - Le nom de la rose (1980)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Nom_de_la_rose_(roman)) #reread #ebook #french
    - One of my favorite books, period!
    - [highlights](Reading/2016-03-31%20-%20Le%20nom%20de%20la%20rose.md)
- 2016-02-16: [Arthur C. Clarke - Rendezvous with Rama (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama) #reread #ebook
    - One of the best science fiction stories ever written.
    - [highlights](Reading/2016-02-16%20-%20Rendezvous%20with%20Rama%20(Arthur%20C.%20Clarke).md)
- 2016-01-09: [Emily Brontë - Wuthering Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights) #reread #ebook #french
	- I read this in French under the title "Les Hauts de Hurlevent". I could have read the original English but just felt like I wanted to read something in French!
	- I think I read this first in the summer of 1992, in French as well.
	- I liked it a lot for its atmosphere and the characters are unforgettable. As the book progresses you just want to know what will happen to Heathcliff in the end. It is all about individual feelings and passions, so definitely a [*Romantic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) work.
	- I also started reading the [graphic novel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907127119), which seems extremely well done, but would benefit from publication in a larger format.

### 2015

- 2015-11-29: [Dan Simmons - The Fall of Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)) #reread #ebook
- 2015-06-14: [Terry Pratchett - Equal Rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rites)
- 2015-05-13: [Terry Pratchett - The Light Fantastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Fantastic)
- 2015-04-xx: [Terry Pratchett - The Color of Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_of_Magic)
- 2015-03-10: [Jules Verne - Cinq semaines en ballon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinq_semaines_en_ballon) #ebook #gutenberg
    - Not as good as "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers", but it's a fairly quick read.
    - This book is mostly about the idea of using a balloon to cross Africa from East to West. The technical aspects are interesting, and handled realistically, except maybe for the source of electricity: while the balloon's hydrogen does leak, the fact that the battery might lose charge is never mentioned AFAICT.
- 2015-03-09: [T. Jack Foster Jr. - The Development of Foster City](http://www.amazon.com/Development-Foster-City-Jr-Jack-ebook/dp/B00CY1LR00/) #ebook
    - This is a short book.
    - Contains some interesting bits, although more depths would have been good.
- 2015-02-19: [Jules Verne - Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (1869-1870)](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vingt_mille_lieues_sous_les_mers) #ebook #gutenberg
- 2015-01-28: [Bright from the Start](http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Start-Science-Backed-Developing-Mindfrom-ebook/dp/B000UCUX46/) #ebook
    - Not that much content in this book. I skimmed very quickly through the second half.
    - I had bought this in August 2010 and probably started reading soon afterwards, but let it rest for a long time.
     - [highlights](Reading/2010-12%20-%20Bright%20from%20the%20Start%20(Paula%20Spencer%20and%20Jill%20Stamm).md)
- 2015-01-28: [Arthur C. Clarke - 3001: Final Odyssey](http://www.amazon.com/3001-Odyssey-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0345423496) #reread #ebook
    - Started reading probably in January 2014, then let it rest.
    - This is the weakest of the Odyssey series. The most interesting part is the appendix, where Clarke comments about some historical bits, where some ideas came from, and even how some of the ideas in the book were already obsolete.

- 2013-08-29: Stefan Zweig - Le joueur d'échecs (Schachnovelle) #reread #audiobook
    - I first read this short book in high school in 1991 for German class (I probably read it in French!). I really liked it and developed interest in Zweig. In the years that followed I read several more of his books.
    - This time I listened to it as an audiobook during commute. It is simply a masterpiece of storytelling.
