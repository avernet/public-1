# Great stuff

Sometimes you encounter things that leave you amazed, touched, hopeful, or maybe even happy. Things that represent perfection of beauty, human creativity, or wisdom.

They can be a piece of music, a sentence in a book, a speech, a movie, a picture. They make you think that life is worth living, and that humanity has some good in itself.

I plan to collect here some "great stuff" to share, even though that can be very personal.

## Books

- [Cosmos](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345331354), by Carl Sagan. It puts science and the universe in perspective. Other books by Sagan are amazing too, such as Pale Blue Dot.

## Music

- *Largo* from *Winter*, from Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* ([here is one interpreation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLyyP5uZpo)). This short piece strikes me as amazingly beautiful. Part of it is that it leaves the solist some freedom to add ornaments.

## Wisdom

- Philosopher Bertrand Russell's [Message to the Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8h-xEuLfm8)
- [Sir Arthur C Clarke: 90th birthday reflections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qLdeEjdbWE) (see also the [transcript](http://www.tveap.org/index.php?q=0712art_transcript_02.php)). This is Clarke's farewell to the world. As he recorded this video, obviously with lots of interruptions, it is quite clear that he knew his own end was near. And he did pass away about three months later.
