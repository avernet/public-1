# Great stuff

Sometimes you encounter things that leave you amazed, touched, or maybe even happy. Things that maybe represent perfection of beauty, or human creativity, things that just 

great stuff in life: a piece of music, a sentence in a book, a movie, a place. Those are Things that make you think that life is worth living, and that humanity has good in it.

I plan to collect here some great stuff to share, even though this can be very personal.

## Music

- *Largo* from *Winter*, from Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* ([here is one interpreation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLyyP5uZpo)). This short piece strikes me as amazingly beautiful. Part of it is that it leaves the solist some freedom to add ornaments.

## Wisdom

- Philosopher Bertrand Russell's [Message to the Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8h-xEuLfm8)
- [Sir Arthur C Clarke: 90th birthday reflections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qLdeEjdbWE) (see also the [transcript](http://www.tveap.org/index.php?q=0712art_transcript_02.php)). This is Clarke's farewell to the world. As he recorded this video, obviously with lots of interruptions, it is quite clear that he knew his own end was near. And he did pass away about three months later.
