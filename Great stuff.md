# Great stuff

Sometimes you encounter things that leave you amazed, touched, hopeful, or maybe even happy. Things that represent perfection of beauty, human creativity, or wisdom.

They can be a piece of music, a sentence in a book, a speech, a movie, a picture. They make you think that life is worth living, and that humanity has some good in itself.

I plan to collect here some "great stuff" to share, even though that can be very personal.

## Books

- [Cosmos](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345331354), by Carl Sagan. It puts science and the universe in perspective. Other books by Sagan are amazing too, such as Pale Blue Dot.
- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041), by Richard Feynman. Intelligence and humor combined.

## Music

- *Largo* from *Winter*, from Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* ([here is one interpreation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLyyP5uZpo)).
  This short piece strikes me as amazingly beautiful. Part of it is that it leaves the solist some freedom to add ornaments.
- *Poeme*, op. 25, by Chausson (See around 4:24 [in this interpretation by David Oistrakh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OE1TmSvpF4)).
  I particularly like Jascha Heifetz's interpretation.
- Legendary soprano Magda Olivero, who passed away in September 2014 at the age of 104, [sang a single phrase from Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini ("Paolo d√†temi pace")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qQqsyPPRhM) at the age of 99. I find the entire sequence amazing:
    - She explains why she decided to sing that phrase with amazing clarity.
    - She courageously decided to sing that phrase publicly, which I find intriguing.
    - Then, there is the voice, which at 99 should not come out at all, yet it does! It is not, in the absolute, the most beautiful voice, but it is remarkable that so much of it is left.
    - She puts her entire body and mind into that phrase. What at beautiful thing to witness, to be able to give oneself to an audience, and that age. Her art seems to transcend the frailty of old age.
    - There is the happiness which follows the execution and the applause.
    - Zandonai's music itself is from an amazing (although rarely performed in modern times) opera, "Francesca da Rimini", which is one of my favorites.

## Wisdom

- Philosopher Bertrand Russell's [Message to the Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8h-xEuLfm8)
- [Sir Arthur C Clarke: 90th birthday reflections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qLdeEjdbWE) (see also the [transcript](http://www.tveap.org/index.php?q=0712art_transcript_02.php)). This is Clarke's farewell to the world. As he recorded this video, obviously with lots of interruptions, it is quite clear that he knew his own end was near. And he did pass away about three months later.
- [Carl Sagan: Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05xxeCdhSo)
- Philosopher Bertrand Russell's "Why I am not a Christian", in interview (YouTube)
