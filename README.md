## About

My name is Erik Bruchez. I was born and raised in Switzerland, where I spent the first 25 years of my life. Since 1997 I have lived in the San Francisco Bay area (with a hiatus around 2005), now in [Foster City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_City,_California). I am married with two kids. I work as a programmer (and *homme Ã  tout faire*) for a small company, [Orbeon](http://www.orbeon.com/), that I co-founded back in 1999 with my friend Alex. I love technology, music, and philosophy. I believe that we have to keep refining our thoughts and view of the world to make any progress in life. Of course, that's easier said than done.

### The concept, and why github

The idea started from [Buster's "public self" repository](https://github.com/busterbenson/public). The concept is to have a public place where to share and refine what's in my mind. With a blog it is harder to look at each post as an ongoing and living document. With a repository of versioned document, the notion of time is applied equally to all the documents. This way it is easier to view everything as an ongoing work in progress. Still, I see the use of github as an experiment. The future will tell if this will work out, and if not I will switch to something else.

*At least in the first version, I am writing this page following the format of Daniel Miessler's [About](http://danielmiessler.com/about/) page, which I find excellent.*
