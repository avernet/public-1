# World view

An important part of the self is the world view ("conception du monde", "Weltanschauung"). As a starting point, this from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view) and this (messy) [paper](http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf)":

> According to Apostel, a worldview is an ontology, or a descriptive model of the world. It should comprise these six elements:

Here is my remix of these elements:

1. Explanation of the world ("What is the nature of our world? How is it structured and how does it function?")
2. Etiology (If I understand well: "How did the world come to be?". This is simlar to #1 it seems.)
3. Futurology ("Where are we heading?")
4. Ethics ("What should we do?")
5. Theory of action ("How should we attain our goals?")
6. Theory of knowledge ("What is true or false?" and "How do we know about the world so we can answer the questions above?")
