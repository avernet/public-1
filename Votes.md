# Voting record

I can't vote in the US, but I do vote in Switzerland as a Swiss Abroad. This document shows how I voted, and then compares that to the actual results when available.

## [Votation populaire du 28 février 2015](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20160228.html) ([results]())

1. [Initiative populaire du 5 novembre 2012 "Pour le couple et la famille - Non à la pénalisation du mariage"](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20160228/imposition-du-couple-et-de-la-famille.html)
	- VOTED: __NO__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](): TODO
	- I would be in favor of marriage being tax-neutral.
	- But this initiative is flawed, and surreptitiously introduces a definition of marriage in the Swiss constitution as being "between a man and a woman".
	- Thus this initiative doesn't appear to be so much about taxes than about introducing this definition of marriage in the constitution, which so far is not present.
	- This is 2016, and I agree with the Federal Council that this is not going in the right direction.
2. [Iinitiative populaire "Pour le renvoi effectif des étrangers criminels"](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20160228/initiative-renvoi-criminels-etrangers.html)
	- VOTED: __NO__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](): TODO
	- Following the Federal Council.
3. [Initiative "Pas de spéculation sur les denrées alimentaires"](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20160228/pas-de-speculation-sur-les-denrees-alimentaires.html)
	- VOTED: __NO__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](): TODO
	- Following the Federal Council: doing this at the level of Switzerland only will not have any effect. On the other hand it can introduce friction.
4. [Réfection du tunnel routier du Gothard](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20160228/tunnel-routier-du-gothard.html)
	- VOTED: __ABSTAINED__
	- EXPECTED: YES
	- [RESULT](): TODO
	- This is about spending close to $3 BILLION for another tunnel.
	- It's unclear where the money comes from. The official information does not clarify this important point.
	- However, other alternatives are also expensive, although not as expensive.
	- Since I lack solid information, I am abstaining.

## [Votation populaire du 14 juin 2015](https://www.ch.ch/fr/votation-federale-14-06-2015/) ([results](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150614/index.html))

1. [Arrêté fédéral du 12 décembre 2014 concernant la modification de l'article constitutionnel relatif à la procréation médicalement assistée et au génie génétique dans le domaine humain](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20150614/praeimplantationsdiagnostik.html)
	- VOTED: __YES__
	- EXPECTED: YES
	- [RESULT](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150614/det592.html): YES 61.9%
	- A no-brainer: it's done in other places already, and it will help lots of couples trying to have children.
2. [Initiative populaire du 20 janvier 2012 «Initiative sur les bourses d'études»](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20150614/stipendieninitiative.html)
	- VOTED: __ABSTAINED__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150614/det593.html): NO 72.5%
	- Is it better for student help to be done at the federal or canton level? I just don't know.
3. [Initiative populaire du 15 février 2013 «Imposer les successions de plusieurs millions pour financer notre AVS (Réforme de la fiscalité successorale)»](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20150614/erbschaftssteuerreform.html)
	- VOTED: __ABSTAINED__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150614/det594.html): NO 71%
	- Another difficult one. To better figure it out I would need concrete examples of how this would impact the successions in various Swiss cantons. This information is not provided by the official booklet. So as I lack information and haven't managed to spend time researching it, I prefer to abstain. This is probably an example of the limits of direct democracy when subjects become technical.
4. [Modification du 26 septembre 2014 de la loi fédérale sur la radio et la télévision](https://www.admin.ch/gov/fr/accueil/documentation/votations/20150614/rtvg.html)
	- VOTED: __ABSTAINED__
	- EXPECTED: NO
	- [RESULT](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150614/det595.html): YES 50.1% (very tight!)
	- This is a difficult one.
	- The Swiss currently pay, per family, CHF 462 (~ USD 496) per year. That's a lot of money for a service you might not be asking for.
	- The new law says this amount will be lower per family (CHF 400 or ~ USD 430). That's an improvement, but it's in the same ballpark.
	- The current system appears wasteful, as it requires enforcement. Since almost all Swiss residents must pay the radio/TV tax anyway, I can see how it can make sense to change the system.
	- But does Switzerland need national radio/TV? Do they serve a significant purpose? Do they produce good or even excellent content? If it has one, should it be that expensive? The UK has Doctor Who and produces great documentaries, for example ;) Swiss radio/TV are not to that level as far as I can tell.
	- If there is any national radio/TV, I think it should constantly work to justify its existence to residents, and work within clear limits. I am not convinced it is doing either, but I might just not be very informed.

1. [«Aider les familles! Pour des allocations pour enfant et des allocations de formation professionnelle exonérées de l’impôt»](https://www.ch.ch/fr/initiative-populaire-aider-les-familles-pour-des-allocations/)
    - VOTED: __NO__
    - EXPECTED: NO
    - [RESULT: NO 75.4%](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150308/det590.html)
    - I am fine helping families.
    - But if the Federal Council is right, it seems that the proposal would only make sense for the most well-off families. That seems to defeat its purpose.
    - I follow the Federal Council.
2. [Initiative populaire «Remplacer la taxe sur la valeur ajoutée par une taxe sur l’énergie»](https://www.ch.ch/fr/initiative-populaire-remplacer-la-taxe-sur-la-valeur-ajoutee/)
    - VOTED: __NO__
    - EXPECTED: NO
    - [RESULT: 92.0%](https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20150308/det591.html)
    - I would be generally ok to tax non-renewable energies or to tax carbon emissions.
    - Replacing the VAT altogether seems to be a curious proposal. Switzerland already has low (8 %) VAT, and there is risk in changing the system so drastically.
    - As the Federal Council says, if the energy tax incentive is introduced and works (as the initiative likely wishes to happen), and the use of non-renewable energies decreases, the revenue from the energy tax would keep getting lower, or the rate would have to keep increasing, in order to keep the same tax revenue. This seems like a difficult system to put in place.
    - I follow the Federal Council.

## [Votation populaire du 30 novembre 2014](https://www.ch.ch/fr/votation-federale-30-11-2014/) ([results](http://www.parlament.ch/E/WAHLEN-ABSTIMMUNGEN/VOLKSABSTIMMUNGEN/VOLKSABSTIMMUNGEN-2014/2014-11-30/Pages/default.aspx))

1. [Initiative populaire "Halte aux privilèges fiscaux des millionnaires (abolition des forfaits fiscaux)"](https://www.ch.ch/fr/abolition-des-forfaits-fiscaux/) __ABSTAINED__ [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 59.2%]
    - I an not a huge fan of giving rich people even more privileges.
    - I also recognize that Switzerland selfishly benefits from doing so.
    - The Federal Council appears to consider this aspect only.
    - This is no clear decision for me here.
    - So I am abstaining.
2. [Initiative populaire "Halte à la surpopulation – Oui à la préservation durable des ressources naturelles" (ECOPOP)](https://www.ch.ch/fr/ecopop/)  __NO__ [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 74.1%]
    - Switzerland just recently (Votation populaire du 9 février 2014) voted to limit immigration, possibly at huge costs related to Switzerland's participation in Europe. A new initiative, along those lines, is not desirable.
    - I love nature and the environment, and Switzerland must work to preserve both, but this initiative will do nothing significant to help.
    - I see it rather as another xenophobic initiative (which means that it could pass!).
    - I am voting firmly NO, and I think that most Swiss citizens will, this time, have more sense than in February.
3. [Initiative populaire "Sauvez l’or de la Suisse (Initiative sur l’or)"](https://www.ch.ch/fr/gold-initiative/) __NO__  [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 77.3%]
    - Gold, really?
    - I am not an economist, but will trust the Federal Council on this one.
    - A clear NO.

1. Initiative populaire "Stop à la TVA discriminatoire pour la restauration!" __NO__ [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 71.5% ]
    - As always, I don't like the tone of the initiative. It is a bit too much to call this "discrimination".
    - It is unclear to me that a few more percents of VAT is discouraging people to eat in restaurants. The initiative doesn't support this with evidence.
    - An 8 % VAT is low by world standards.
    - I understand the Federal Council's argument that losing revenue would be an issue, and so would be raising the VAT on food in general.
    - So I reject the initiative.
2. Initiative populaire "Pour une caisse publique d'assurance-maladie" __ABSTAINED__ [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 61.8% ]
    - Didn't we vote on this once already?
    - I agree with the initiative that the current situation is not ideal and that there might be only the appearance of competition between insurances.
    - However I also agree with the Federal Council that the current system seems to work reasonably well and is being improved. Changing it does have some risk.
    - I definitely would like to see more transparency and oversight of the insurance companies.
    - A better way to go forward would be a "public option", that is, that the government would be allowed to offer its own insurance, possibly without advertising, and without making profits, in competition with the other insurances. If the public massively moves to the public insurance, then the message is clear: the government can offer better insurance services (for example due to reduced advertising and advertising costs). If on the other hand the public still prefers the private insurances, then the government would be free to stop offering its service, realizing that it cannot compete.
    - I cannot make up my mind here. So I abstained.

1. Arrêté fédéral concernant les soins médicaux de base YES [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: YES 88%]
    - The Federal Council's arguments seem reasonable.
2. Initiative populaire "Pour que les pédophiles ne travaillent plus avec des enfants" NO [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: YES 63.5%]
    - I agree with the Federal Council's argument that proportionality is important.
    - In general I don't think that draconian laws are effective.
3. Initiative populaire "Pour la protection de salaires équitables" NO [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 76.3%]
    - I agree with the Federal Council that the minimum salary suggested of CHF 22/hour might be too high.
    - I think that in the future, the solution might be a basic income, but the time might not be right yet.
4. Loi fédérale sur le fonds d'acquisition de l'avion de combat Gripen NO [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: NO 53.4%]
    - It's debatable whether Switzerland even needs its own figher jets. It has some already.
    - The money available could be put to better uses, including education. Some of it could even be spent on increasing work with other armed forces for security.

1. Arrêté fédéral portant règlement du financement et de l'aménagement de l'infrastructure ferroviaire (FAIF) YES [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: YES 62%]
    - Public transportation is very important in Switzerland and does deserve support.
    - Crowded trains are a problem.
    - I place some faith in the federal council that the new financing scheme will be good.
2. Initiative populaire "Financer l'avortement est une affaire privée" NO [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 69.8%]
    - I agree with the federal council that abortion laws in Switzerland are pretty good.
    - According to the federal council, the Swiss people agreed that insurance should cover costs in 2002.
    - As usual, the "arguments" of the proponents are unconvincing.
    - The proponents do sound religiously motivated.
3. Initiative populaire "Contre l'immigration de masse" NO [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: YES 50.3%]
    - I reckon that immigration is not without problems in Switzerland.
    - However, the consequence of renouncing the agreements with the rest of Europe would be terrible.
    - In short, this initiative is not an acceptable solution for immigration-related issues in Switzerland.
    - I don't think it's going to pass, but I fear that it might, like some right-wing initiatives in the past.

## [Votation populaire du 24 novembre 2013](http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/va/20131124/index.html?lang=fr) ([results](http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20131124/index.html))

1. Acceptez-vous l'initiative populaire "1:12 - Pour des salaires équitables"? NO [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 65.3%]
    - This is similar to the initiative "«contre les rémunérations abusives»" of June 2012.
    - I don't like how executives' compensations have been evolving, the widening of the gap between rich and poor, or
      that society allows for the emergence of an ultra-rich class, especially given the dubious value to society of the
      function of most of those executives. But I don't think that enforcing a ratio as suggested is going to do good
      for Switzerland, or even to work.
    - Following the Federal Council's recommendation.
2. Acceptez-vous l'initiative populaire "Initiative pour les familles: déductions fiscales aussi pour les parents qui gardent eux-mêmes leurs enfants"? ABSTAINED [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 58.5%]
    - Switzerland is lagging when it comes to helping families with children.
    - Raising children at home is an activity of value to society, even if not remunerated.
    - But should a tax deduction be the tool to use here?
    - I often have a problem with tax incentives as they can backfire and almost always have elements of unfairness.
    - The tax deductions I know are linked to money you spend, not other non-remunerated activities.
    - In short, I don't know what to vote here, so abstaining
3. Acceptez-vous la modification du 22 mars 2013 de la loi fédérale concernant la redevance pour l'utilisation des
   routes nationales (Loi sur la vignette autorouotière, LVA)? YES [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: NO 60.5%]
    - 100 CHF / year doesn't seem like so much to use the Swiss highways.
    - As the federal council says, it's easily more expensive in other countries.
    - It is hard, based on the vote booklet, to understand the financing scheme exactly. But the arguments against the
      new law are explained poorly (the main argument seems to be using lots of exclamation points).
    - One criticism of the law seems to be that money raised by road users is used for public transportation. But I
      think it is a rather reasonable thing to do.
    - Following the Federal Council's recommendation.

1. Acceptez-vous l'initiative populaire "Oui a I‘abrogation du service militaire obligatoire"? YES [EXPECTED: NO, RESULT: NO 73.2% ]
     - Switzerland is a neutral country. A large armed force is unneeded. Security can be ensured by a police force and a professional army. Be creative.
     - I agree with the initiative: the time citizens spend in the army is mostly a huge waste of time. If the army had a real formative function, I could support it more easily, especially if there was an open option for civil service. But it should be serious.
     - I haven't myself experienced much of a cohesive function to the Swiss army.
     - I think that the initiative will be rejected, as much of the country, especially in the Swiss-German part, is more attached to this institution.
1. Acceptez-vous la loi fédérale du 28 septembre 2012 sur la lutte contre les maladies transmissibles de l‘homme (Loi sur les épidémies, LEp)? YES [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: YES 60% ]
     - I might even support a law *mandating* vaccination to protect populations, but it seems that the law doesn't go that far. If anything it seems pretty mild and balanced.
     - Children need to be informed about sexually transmitted infections as soon as possible.
     - The referendum against this law seems to originate from the conservative far-right, claiming that "the state shouldn't be involved in education". As a pragmatist I believe on the contrary that the state should be involved to guarantee that education is based on scientific data, and guarantee a baseline of information which benefits the whole of society.
1. Acceptez-vous la modification du 14 décembre 2012 de la loi fédérale sur le travail dans l‘industrie, l‘artisanat et le commerce (Loi sur le travail, LTr)? YES [EXPECTED: YES, RESULT: YES 55.8% ]
     - Living in the US, having a few stores in gas stations open 24/24 seems like a very benign thing to support.
     - Even with such an exemption, opening hours of stores in Switzerland still remain inadapted to the working population.

## [Votation fédérale du 9 juin 2013](http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/va/20130609/index.html?lang=fr)

1. Acceptez-vous l'initiative populaire «Election du Conseil fédéral par le peuple»? NO [RESULT: NO 76.3%]
     - It is unclear that the proposed initiative would make the Swiss democracy better. There is already *a lot* of direct democracy in Switzerland. It might be interesting to see if the idea can be pushed even further by electing directly even more officials, but there might be unintended consequences and the question is whether it is worth risking breaking a system that works pretty well as it is.
     - Switzerland is lucky to be able to avoid the massive presidential (and other) campaigns of the US and France It would be a shame to see Federal Councillors spending all their time campaigning instead of doing actual work.
     - A democratic government is a lot about *delegating* responsibilities to elected official. I don't see much wrong, in principle, with delegating the particular responsbility of organizing the Federal Council to the Parliament.
     - I am from the French-speaking minority, yet I don't like very much the idea of requiring that a number of Councillors come from a particular area. What if candidates from the French-speaking region are mediocre? Wouldn't it be better to have instead qualified candidates, wherever they might be from? The pool of talent in a country with 7 million people is already pretty limited. It seems wrong to reduce that pool even more.
1. Acceptez-vous la modification du 28 septembre 2012 de la loi sur l'asile (LAsi)(Modifications urgentes de la loi sur l'asile)? YES [RESULT: YES 78.5%]

    Here too I follow the recommendation from the Federal Council. My only worry regards this humanitarian visa. Is that something concrete, and is that enough?

## [Votation fédérale du 3 mars 2013](http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/va/03032013/index.html?lang=fr)

1. Acceptez-vous l'arrêté fédéral du 15 juin 2012 sur la politique familiale? YES [RESULT: NO]

    Switzerland can certainly do more to help working families who want to have kids. Following the Federal Council's recommendation.

2. Acceptez-vous l'initiative populaire «contre les rémunérations abusives»? NO [RESULT: YES 67.9%]

    I don't like the insane compensations of company executives, but I am not sure the suggested law will have a positive effect. Following the Federal Council's recommendation.

1. Acceptez-vous la modification du 15 juin 2012 de la loi fédérale sur l'aménagement du territoire? ABSTAINED [RESULT: YES 62.9%]

    My understanding of the issue and its consequences is not good enough, so I abstained.
