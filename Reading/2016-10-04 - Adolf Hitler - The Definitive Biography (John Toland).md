Can you imagine Lohengrin’s narration on a barrel organ?”

He screamed and fidgeted with his hands. But when he was quiet it was quite different; he seemed to have a fair amount of self-control and acted in quite a dignified manner.”

> Hitler himself claimed in Mein Kampf that he had become a dedicated anti-Semite in Vienna upon his discovery that the Jew was the “cold-hearted, shameless, and calculating director” of prostitution; that the music and art worlds were controlled by Jews; and, most important, that the Social Democrat press was “directed predominantly by Jews.” More likely these revelations came much later and his prejudice was little more than that of the average Viennese. Almost every gentile in the Austrian capital was an anti-Semite.

> There could have been a dawning hatred of Dr. Bloch, even though Hitler sent him cordial New Year’s wishes a year after Klara’s death and signed it “Your ever grateful Adolf Hitler.” It is not at all uncommon for a bereaved son to blame a doctor, consciously or unconsciously, for the death of a beloved parent.

> Munich in 1913 with its 600,000 inhabitants was, after Paris, about the liveliest cultural center in Europe, and for some years had been attracting a breed of artists that Hitler himself found decadent: Paul Klee from Switzerland and refugees from the east like Kandinsky, Jawlensky and the Burliuk brothers.

No one wanted war more than he: “Even today,” he wrote in Mein Kampf, “I am not ashamed to say that, overcome with rapturous enthusiasm, I fell to my knees and thanked Heaven from an overflowing heart for granting me the good fortune of being allowed to live at this time.” To him it meant the realization of the Greater Germany he had dreamed of since youth.

When it slackened they could hear under them the ominous sound of digging—the enemy was boring tunnels. Overhead came the drone of planes, then the crash of bombs. In addition there was the constant threat of gas and the men sometimes had to keep their suffocating masks on for twenty-four hours at a stretch.

I hated nothing more than trash literature. When we are concerned with the fate of mankind then one can only read Homer and evangelical works.

Finally, on November 9, the Kaiser reluctantly abdicated, turning power over to the moderate socialists who were led by a former saddlemaker, Friedrich Ebert. It was the end of the German Empire, begun in France on January 18, 1871, when Wilhelm I, King of Prussia and grandfather of Wilhelm II, was proclaimed the first Emperor of Germany in the Hall of Mirrors at the Versailles Palace.

It was the Kaiser and the imperial German generals, of course, who had lost the war but President Wilson had refused to make an armistice with them, insisting he could deal only with democratic elements. And by forcing the socialists to assume the blame for something they had not brought about, Wilson gave Adolf Hitler a political tool that he was destined to wield with devastating force.

He attended rival rallies and invariably found that the main speaker delivered his address “in the style of a witty newspaper article or of a scientific treatise, avoided all strong words, and here and there threw in some feeble professional joke.” Such tedious meetings taught him what not to do. He made his own lively and rousing. The atmosphere was down-to-earth and genial with free beer, sausages and pretzels, and even, when party funds permitted, concertina music and folk singing. Then at the psychological moment Hitler himself would make a dramatic appearance with band playing and swastika banners flying. Usually he began quietly.

To put the population on wheels, he was developing a “People’s Car” so compact and inexpensive that the average German could afford it. He asked Ferdinand Porsche to design a vehicle that would get some forty miles per gallon, accommodate four passengers and have an air-cooled engine that would not freeze up in winter. He envisaged other innovations for the future. In large cities there would be automated underground parking, traffic-free centers, numerous parks and green areas, and strict pollution control. In line with his personal obsession with cleanliness (perhaps in connection with his recurring poison-cancer phobia), the problem of pollution so concerned him that he encouraged industry to work toward the complete elimination of noxious gases. Anti-pollution contrivances were already installed in some factories in the Ruhr basin, and new plants were required to construct preventive devices to avoid pollution of the waters.

Communists and Nazis alike were self-righteous and dogmatic; both were totalitarian and both believed that the end justified the means, sanctifying injustice, as it were, in the name of the state and progress.

Their disillusionment today therefore is all the greater. You have to see their faces to measure it.”

> Thanks in large part to Hitler’s own brutal treatment of Soviet prisoners, these men were treated inhumanely. Reportedly more than 400,000 German, Italian and Romanian prisoners of war died between February and April 1942. Starvation was the chief cause of death and cannibalism became a common practice. The strong alone survived and these lived on excrement from which undigested corn and mullet was picked and washed. Only a few thousand of those captured at Stalingrad would ever return to Germany. One was Paulus, who pleased the Soviets by publicly condemning Hitler and Nazism.

He requested Mussolini’s resignation, then revealed he had already appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as head of government. “I am sorry, I am sorry,” he was heard to say through the door. “But the solution could not have been otherwise.” The little King accompanied Il Duce to the front door where he shook his hand warmly.

> One particularly horrifying aspect of Hitler’s Final Solution had recently come to an apocalyptical ending. Of the 380,000 Jews crowded into the Warsaw ghetto, all but 70,000 had been deported to the killing centers in an operation devoid of resistance. By this time, however, those left behind had come to the realization that deportation meant death. With this in mind, Jewish political parties within the ghetto finally resolved their differences and banded together to resist further shipments with force. They did so to Himmler’s amazement and he thereupon ordered the total dissolution of the Warsaw ghetto. At three in the morning of April 9, 1943, more than 2000 Waffen SS infantrymen—accompanied by tanks, flame throwers and dynamite squads—invaded the ghetto, expecting an easy conquest, only to be met by determined fire from 1500 fighters armed with weapons smuggled into the ghetto over a long period: several light machine guns, hand grenades, a hundred or so rifles and carbines, several hundred pistols and revolvers, and Molotov cocktails. Himmler had expected the action to take three days but by nightfall his forces had to withdraw. The one-sided battle continued day after day to the bewilderment of the SS commander, General Jürgen Stroop, who could not understand why “this trash and subhumanity” refused to abandon a hopeless cause. He reported that, although his men had initially captured “considerable numbers of Jews, who are cowards by nature,” it was becoming more and more difficult. “Over and over again new battle groups consisting of twenty to thirty Jewish men, accompanied by a corresponding number of women, kindled new resistance.” The women, he noted, had the disconcerting habit of suddenly hurling grenades they had hidden in their bloomers.

You see, in Germany it was understood that if something went wrong, then the man who gave the orders was responsible.” Nor did these executioners ever question whether the Jews deserved their fate. “Don’t you see, we SS men were not supposed to think about these things; it never even occurred to us.… We were all so trained to obey orders, without even thinking, that the thought of disobeying an order would simply never have occurred to anybody, and somebody else would have done it just as well if I hadn’t.” Besides, those who participated in the exterminations had been trained so rigorously “that one would shoot his own brother if ordered to. Orders were everything.”

Messages of congratulation descended on the Wolfsschanze. Field Marshal Milch for one telegraphed his “HEARTFELT JOY THAT A MERCIFUL PROVIDENCE HAS SHIELDED YOU FROM THIS BASE MURDER ATTEMPT AND PRESERVED YOU FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND ITS WEHRMACHT.” These expressions of relief were not completely self-serving. The great majority of Germans felt that the nation’s future depended on the Führer.

Every officer, regardless of rank, is now under your command.” He ordered Remer to restore full order immediately. “If necessary by brachial (brutal) armed force.” The “brachial” completely convinced Remer this really was Hitler. He snapped to attention. “You are responsible only to me,” repeated Hitler and promoted him to the rank of colonel.

Stauffenberg, his left sleeve soaked in blood, stood stiffly as he and his three colleagues were led into the courtyard. Beck’s face was splotched with blood. He asked for and was given a pistol. He was left in the anteroom but those outside heard him say: “If it doesn’t work this time, please help me.” There was a shot.

It was a blow to his convictions that only a small clique of traitors existed and he was hurt. “My life is so full of sorrow, so heavily leaden,” he told Traudl Junge, “that death itself would be salvation.” And another secretary heard him chide his dog for disobeying him: “Look me in the eyes, Blondi.

In line with Hitler’s specific instructions, the eight men were trucked to Plötenzee prison, then into a small room where eight meathooks dangled from the ceiling. Here the condemned were stripped to the waist and hung by nooses of piano wire. Their agonized jerking was recorded by a movie camera, and that same evening was reproduced on a screen at the Wolfsschanze.

At Wolfsschanze Hitler read the letter, then, without comment, handed it to Jodl, who was surprised by the last lines wherein Kluge praised Hitler for his iron will and genius and the “great and honorable fight” he had fought. “Prove yourself now to be so great as to put an end, if need be, to the hopeless struggle.” It seemed to epitomize the final humiliation of the Wehrmacht but was not at all self-serving.

He told Himmler that six million Jews had already been eliminated—four million in the killing camps and the rest in mobile operations. Spurred by the rapid advance of the Red Army and the continuing investigations of the inexorable Konrad Morgen, who also calculated a figure of at least six million dead Jews, Hitler instructed Himmler to prepare the dismantling of all the killing camps except Auschwitz.3 There were still Jews from Hungary, Lodz, Slovakia and Theresienstadt to be gassed but Commandant Höss had the facilities to wind up the entire job, provided the troops in the East did not allow a Soviet breakthrough.

Gratitude ripened into trust and before long the new doctor enjoyed a rare personal relationship with the Führer. The treatments were invariably followed by long discussions on a variety of subjects, ranging from the future of the Reich to the evils of smoking. During all these conversations Giesing continued to take detailed notes. He also undertook something even more dangerous: secret psychological tests. This was done so subtly and over such a long period that Hitler never guessed he had been the object of, in Giesing’s terms, “rather primitive psychological tests,” and had been diagnosed as “a neurotic with Caesar-mania.”

Most of them shared Gerda Christian’s opinion that Morell was a good doctor despite his slovenly appearance. Even the trio who denounced Morell for incompetence did not believe he was trying to poison Hitler. They remembered the truly shocked look on his face when Brandt pointed out that these pills—though harmless if taken in moderation—contained some strychnine. Morell, it seemed, had never checked the analysis on the label, only the name, nux vomica. And it came as a blow to discover that this was a strychnine-containing seed.

On October 14 they visited Rommel, who was recuperating at his castle near Ulm from the auto accident. When they left an hour later an ashen Rommel told his wife, “In a quarter of an hour I shall be dead.” He explained that he had been accused of complicity in the plot and Hitler offered him the choice of taking poison or facing the People’s Court. After bidding his wife and son farewell, he took his aide aside. “Aldinger,” he said, “this is it.” He repeated Hitler’s proposition and plan: he was supposed to drive to Ulm with the two generals and, en route, take poison. Half an hour later his death by accident would be reported. He would be given a state funeral and his family would not be persecuted. Aldinger begged him to resist but Rommel said that was impossible.

The communiqué was widely acclaimed in the United States, England and the Soviet Union. It also delighted Goebbels, for it gave him an opportunity to resurrect the bogey of unconditional surrender. The decision of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin at Yalta to dismember Germany and force her to pay crushing reparations, he argued, proved that Germany must fight with renewed vigor—or be obliterated.

On March 18 Speer brought his protest against this “scorched earth” policy directly to the Führer. “At this stage of the war,” he wrote in a memorandum, “it makes no sense for us to undertake demolitions which may strike at the very life of the nation.” If Hitler had ever wavered in determination to scorch German earth, Speer’s words spurred him to action. He summoned his quondam architect moments after reading his memorandum and said icily, “If the war is lost, the people will be lost also. It is not necessary to worry about what the German people will need for elemental survival. On the contrary, it is best for us to destroy even these things. For the nation has proved to be the weaker, and the future belongs to the stronger Eastern nation [the Soviet Union].

These same laws make it inevitable that both powers should become enemies of Europe.

Even the majority of citizens still kept faith with him, despite the relentless bombings from the West and the rapidly shrinking borders of the Reich. To the average German the Führer was more than a man, he was a supernatural phenomenon. They held positive belief in his invulnerability, many clinging to the popular myth that a house wall bearing his picture could withstand any bomb. His miraculous escape on the twentieth of July bore witness to his indestructibility, making it that much easier to raise their spirits and hopes with such slogans as “Hitler Is Victory Itself.” In private, the creator of this slogan had lost his own faith. Goebbels disconsolately began preparing for the end, and started by burning his papers and personal mementos. He hesitated before destroying a large autographed photograph of his great love, Lida Baarova. “Now, there’s a beautiful woman!” he remarked.

Himmler explained that he had been empowered to solve the Jewish problem and had first planned a humane solution through emigration. But even those countries which boasted of their friendliness toward the Jews refused to take them. “Through the war,” Himmler said, “we came into contact with the masses of the Eastern Jewish proletariat, and this created new problems. We could not have such an enemy in our back.” These Jews not only helped the partisans but were infected by typhus and other diseases. “In order to curtail the epidemics,” he explained, “we had to build crematoria where we could bum the corpses of the large number of people who died because of these diseases.

Hitler refused to go that far and sent his Reichsmarschall three conflicting messages. The first offered to disregard the death penalty for high treason if Göring resigned all his offices; the second rescinded the decree establishing Göring as his successor; and the third, perhaps more accurately reflecting Hitler’s confused feelings, was couched in such vague terms (“Your assumption that I am prevented from carrying out my own wishes is an absolutely erroneous idea whose ridiculous origin I do not know”) that Bormann must have feared it was a prelude to forgiveness.

> Skeptics wondered why Stalin had spread the story in 1945 that Hitler had escaped when he knew the body had been found. They were not at all convinced by Bezymenski’s explanation: “First, it was resolved not to publish the results of the forensic medical report but to ‘hold it in reserve’ in case someone might try to slip into the role of ‘the Führer saved by a miracle.’ Secondly, it was resolved to continue the investigations in order to exclude any possibility of error or deliberate deception.” Neither reason accounts for the wait of twenty-three years, nor was any explanation given for the destruction of the remains. Pictures of the corpse’s dentures had been kept on file and in 1972 Dr. Reidar Soggnaes, a dental forensic expert from U.C.L.A., discovered that these teeth exactly matched those in the X-ray head plates of Hitler taken in 1943. This hard evidence, Dr. Soggnaes told the 6th International Meeting of Forensic Sciences at Edinburgh, proved beyond doubt that Hitler was dead and that the Soviets had autopsied the right body. But where was the proof that Hitler had not shot himself? The skull “proving” that there was no bullet hole had been conveniently destroyed. Moreover, none of the eyewitnesses in the bunker had noticed the telltale discolorations of cyanamide on Hitler’s lips; and only one empty poison capsule had been found.

> Children, don’t be afraid,” she said, “the doctor is going to give you an injection, a kind that is now given to all children and soldiers.” After a dentist named Kunz injected morphine to make the children sleepy, Frau Goebbels herself placed a crushed ampule containing potassium cyanide in the mouth of each child.

> The fate of Martin Bormann was more controversial than his master’s. It was generally assumed that he had died while attempting to escape from Berlin but declassified United States and British intelligence documents indicated that he might have escaped to Bolzano, Italy, where his wife had already fled from Berchtesgaden with their nine children. For the next twenty-seven years there were recurring reports of Bormann’s reappearance, particularly in Argentina. Then, late in 1972, an American author, Ladislas Farago, claimed he had positive proof Bormann was alive in South America. This sensational announcement was followed a few days later by another. The German authorities declared that they had just found Bormann’s body near the Führer bunker. Dr. Soggnaes, who had authenticated the Hitler corpse, asked permission to examine the skull so he could corroborate the dental identification. At first permission was withheld, adding suspicion that the corpse might be a hoax. Finally in the summer of 1973 Dr. Soggnaes was allowed to examine the skeletal remains as well as the maxillary incisor bridge which had been found three months after the skull was unearthed. Dr. Soggnaes returned to U.C.L.A. to prepare a forensic analysis of the data. In September 1974 he presented his material to the World Congress of the Federation of Dentaire Internationale in London. The skull, he concluded, was indeed that of Bormann. And the mystery of Hitler’s most faithful servant was finally solved.

> That evening Himmler cryptically told his closest friends that an important new task remained. A few could accompany him. He shaved off his mustache, put a patch over one eye, changed his name and—with some nine followers, including his chief Waffen SS adjutant, Werner Grothmann—went into hiding. When Grothmann discovered his chief had a cyanide capsule and intended to use it if necessary, he accused Himmler of taking an easy way out that was not open to his followers. It was the Reichsführer’s duty, he said, not only to assume responsibility for his men’s actions but to make clear that the Waffen SS, the SD and the concentration camp guards were from distinctly different organizations. Himmler demurred. “After I take the poison,” he said, “then you young officers must tell the world what happened here in Germany—what I did and what I did not do.” Within two weeks Himmler was captured by the British. A doctor conducting a routine examination noticed something in his mouth, but when he reached in to pull out the object Himmler bit down on the cyanide capsule and died instantly

> At 10:45 P.M. October 15, 1946, Göring cheated the hangman with a cyanide capsule. Two hours later the executions began. The first to climb the thirteen steps of the gallows was Ribbentrop. “God protect Germany,” he said loudly. “My last wish is that Germany’s unity shall be preserved and that an understanding be reached between East and West.” It had taken the incontrovertible evidence at Nuremberg to convince him that masses of Jews had been killed, for Hitler had assured him time and again that the Jewish problem would be solved by deportation. “I never dreamed,” he told G. M. Gilbert, an American psychologist, “it would end like this!”

> Next came Keitel. Minutes earlier he had sobbed while the chaplain gave him a last benediction. Now his chin was thrust out. “I call on the Almighty God to have mercy on the German people. For Germany—everything. Thank you!” He turned to the chaplain, an American. “I thank you and those who sent you with all my heart.” The hangman, Master Sergeant John Woods, had looked forward with relish to these executions. He adjusted the rope around Keitel’s neck, then placed a black hood over his head. At the very last moment the field marshal shouted, “Deutschland über Alles!” During the trial Keitel had confided to Gilbert that Hitler had betrayed him. “If he did not deceive us by deliberate lies, then he did it by deliberately keeping us in the dark and letting us fight under a false impression!”

> A surprising number of Hitler’s family circle survived the last cataclysmic days: the four secretaries; his two favorite architects, Speer and Giesler; his pilot, Baur; his chauffeur, Kempka; his valet, Linge; Heim and Koeppen, who copied down his table conversations; the best friend of his wife, Frau Schneider; his two favorite fighters, Skorzeny and Rudel; the three women he particularly admired: Leni Riefenstahl, Gerdy Troost and Helene Hanfstaengl. A number of his adjutants and ordnance officers not only survived but were willing to talk freely of their experiences: Puttkamer, Engel, Below, Wünsche, Schulze and Günsche.
