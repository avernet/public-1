Pinker is missing the overall point here. It is true that biologically, evolution has no specific direction. It is a search method that indeed thoroughly fills out the “densely branching bush” of nature. It is likewise true that evolutionary changes do not necessarily move in the direction of greater intelligence—they move in all directions. There are many examples of successful creatures that have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years. (Alligators, for instance, date back 200 million years, and many microorganisms go back much further than that.) But in the course of thoroughly filling out myriad evolutionary branches, one of the directions it does move in is toward greater intelligence. That is the relevant point for the purposes of this discussion.

The pattern recognition theory of mind that I articulate in this book is based on a different fundamental unit: not the neuron itself, but rather an assembly of neurons, which I estimate to number around a hundred. The wiring and synaptic strengths within each unit are relatively stable and determined genetically—that is, the organization within each pattern recognition module is determined by genetic design. Learning takes place in the creation of connections between these units, not within them, and probably in the synaptic strengths of those interunit connections.

Recent support for the basic module of learning’s being a module of dozens of neurons comes from Swiss neuroscientist Henry Markram (born in 1962), whose ambitious Blue Brain Project to simulate the entire human brain I describe in chapter 7 . In a 2011 paper he describes how while scanning and analyzing actual mammalian neocortex neurons, he was “search[ing] for evidence of Hebbian assemblies at the most elementary level of the cortex.” What he found instead, he writes, were “elusive assemblies [whose] connectivity and synaptic weights are highly predictable and constrained.” He concludes that “these findings imply that experience cannot easily mold the synaptic connections of these assemblies” and speculates that “they serve as innate, Lego-like building blocks of knowledge for perception and that the acquisition of memories involves the combination of these building blocks into complex constructs.”

If anything good happens to us—winning the lottery, gaining the recognition of our peers, getting a hug from a loved one, or even subtle achievements such as getting a friend to laugh at a joke—we experience a release of dopamine.

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a major role in the regulation of mood. In higher levels it is associated with feelings of well-being and contentment. Serotonin has other functions, including modulating synaptic strength, appetite, sleep, sexual desire, and digestion. Antidepression drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (which tend to increase serotonin levels available to receptors) tend to have far-reaching effects, not all of them desirable (such as suppressing libido).

A mouse that finds an escape route when confronted with the household cat—and can do so even if the situation is somewhat different from what it has ever encountered before—is being creative. Our own creativity is orders of magnitude greater than that of the mouse—and involves far more levels of abstraction—because we have a much larger neocortex, which is capable of greater levels of hierarchy. So one way to achieve greater creativity is by effectively assembling more neocortex.

The other approach is to take one or more biological human brains that have already gained sufficient knowledge to converse in meaningful language and to otherwise behave in a mature manner and copy their neocortical patterns into the simulated brain. The problem with this method is that it requires a noninvasive and nondestructive scanning technology of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution and speed to perform such a task quickly and completely. I would not expect such an “uploading” technology to be available until around the 2040s. (The computational requirement to simulate a brain at that degree of precision, which I estimate to be 1019 calculations per second, will be available in a supercomputer according to my projections by the early 2020s; however, the necessary nondestructive brain scanning technologies will take longer.)

There is a third approach, which is the one I believe simulation projects such as Blue Brain will need to pursue. One can simplify molecular models by creating functional equivalents at different levels of specificity, ranging from my own functional algorithmic method (as described in this book) to simulations that are closer to full molecular simulations. The speed of learning can thereby be increased by a factor of hundreds or thousands depending on the degree of simplification used. An educational program can be devised for the simulated brain (using the functional model) that it can learn relatively quickly. Then the full molecular simulation can be substituted for the simplified model while still using its accumulated learning. We can then simulate learning with the full molecular model at a much slower speed.

We have accomplished four things with this process. First, we have greatly reduced the complexity of the data. Second, we have reduced sixteen-dimensional data to one-dimensional data (that is, each sample is now a single number). Third, we have improved our ability to find invariant features, because we are emphasizing portions of the space of possible sounds that convey the most information. Most combinations of frequencies are physically impossible or at least very unlikely, so there is no reason to give equal space to unlikely combinations of inputs as to likely ones. This technique reduces the data to equally likely possibilities. The fourth benefit is that we can use one-dimensional pattern recognizers, even though the original data consisted of many more dimensions. This turned out to be the most efficient approach to utilizing available computational resources.

The neocortex, in contrast, programs itself, filling its “statements” (that is, the lists) with meaningful and actionable information from its own experience and from its own feedback loops. This is a key principle of how the neocortex works: Each one of its pattern recognizers (that is, each LISP-like statement) is capable of filling in its own list and connecting itself both up and down to other lists. The second difference is the size parameters. One could create a variant of LISP (coded in LISP) that would allow for handling such parameters, but these are not part of the basic language.

Upon identifying an inconsistent idea, the digital module would begin a search for a resolution, including its own cortical structures as well as all of the vast literature available to it. A resolution might simply mean determining that one of the inconsistent ideas is simply incorrect (if contraindicated by a preponderance of conflicting data). More constructively, it would find an idea at a higher conceptual level that resolves the apparent contradiction by providing a perspective that explains each idea. The system would add this resolution as a new pattern and link to the ideas that initially triggered the search for the resolution. This critical thinking module would run as a continual background task. It would be very beneficial if human brains did the same thing.

One aspect of his work that I do disagree with, however, is his assessment of the brain’s memory capacity. He assumes that the brain remembers every input for its entire life. Von Neumann assumes an average life span of 60 years, or about 2 × 109 seconds. With about 14 inputs to each neuron per second (which is actually low by at least three orders of magnitude) and with 1010 neurons, he arrives at an estimate of about 1020 bits for the brain’s memory capacity. The reality, as I have noted earlier, is that we remember only a very small fraction of our thoughts and experiences, and even these memories are not stored as bit patterns at a low level (such as a video image), but rather as sequences of higher-level patterns.

But it is not clear that it refers to something real.

The word “spiritual” is often used to denote the things that are of ultimate significance. Many people don’t like to use such terminology from spiritual or religious traditions, because it implies sets of beliefs that they may not subscribe to. But if we strip away the mystical complexities of religious traditions and simply respect “spiritual” as implying something of profound meaning to humans, then the concept of consciousness fits the bill. It reflects the ultimate spiritual value. Indeed, “spirit” itself is often used to denote consciousness.

I suggest that “free will” is our apparent ability to choose and act upon whichever of those seem most useful or appropriate, and our insistence upon the idea that such choices are our own. —Richard D. Alexander

If we lose one, we do lose the cortical patterns that are uniquely stored there, but each brain is in itself fairly complete. So does each hemisphere have its own consciousness? There is an argument to be made that such is the case.

Rather than free will, Ramachandran suggests we should talk about “free won’t”—that is, the power to reject solutions proposed by the nonconscious parts of our neocortex.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as the “freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention.” You will notice that this definition is hopelessly circular: “Free will is freedom….”

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that free will is the “capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives.” By this definition, a simple computer is capable of free will, so it is less helpful than the dictionary definition.

Wikipedia is actually a bit better. It defines free will as “the ability of agents to make choices free from certain kinds of constraints…. The constraint of dominant concern has been…determinism.”

it is nonetheless not nearly as complex as a human neocortex. Watson does possess a lot of knowledge, and it does use hierarchical methods, but the complexity of its hierarchical thinking is still considerably less than that of a human. So is the difference simply one of the scale of complexity of its hierarchical thinking? There is an argument to be made that the issue does come down to this.

The compatibilists argue, essentially, that you’re free to decide what you want even though what you decide is or may be determined. Daniel Dennett, for example, argues that while the future may be determined from the state of the present, the reality is that the world is so intricately complex that we cannot possibly know what the future will bring.

If the universe is a giant cellular automaton, as Dr. Wolfram postulates, there would be no computer big enough—since every computer would be a subset of the universe—that could run such a simulation. Therefore the future state of the universe is completely unknowable even though it is deterministic.

We cannot predict the future of a class IV automaton except to let the future unfold. For Dr. Wolfram, this is sufficient to allow for free will.

My own leap of faith is that I believe that humans have free will, and while I act as if that is the case, I am hard pressed to find examples among my own decisions that illustrate that. Consider the decision to write this book—I never made that decision. Rather, the idea of the book decided that for me.

Although I share Descartes’ confidence that I am conscious, I’m not so sure about free will. It is difficult to escape Schopenhauer’s conclusion that “you can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.” 20 Nonetheless I will continue to act as if I have free will and to believe in it, so long as I don’t have to explain why.

The quintessential example of the law of accelerating returns is the perfectly smooth, doubly exponential growth of the price/performance of computation, which has held steady for 110 years through two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reemergence of China, the recent financial crisis, and all of the other notable events of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and early twenty-first centuries.

Exponentially expanding computational and communication technologies all contribute to the project to understand and re-create the methods of the human brain. This effort is not a single organized project but rather the result of a great many diverse projects, including detailed modeling of constituents of the brain ranging from individual neurons to the entire neocortex, the mapping of the “connectome” (the neural connections in the brain), simulations of brain regions, and many others. All of these have been scaling up exponentially.

It appears to me that many critics will not be satisfied until computers routinely pass the Turing test, but even that threshold will not be clear-cut. Undoubtedly, there will be controversy as to whether claimed Turing tests that have been administered are valid. Indeed, I will probably be among those critics disparaging early claims along these lines. By the time the arguments about the validity of a computer passing the Turing test do settle down, computers will have long since surpassed unenhanced human intelligence.

From quantitative improvement comes qualitative advance. The most important evolutionary advance in Homo sapiens was quantitative: the development of a larger forehead to accommodate more neocortex. Greater neocortical capacity enabled this new species to create and contemplate thoughts at higher conceptual levels, resulting in the establishment of all the varied fields of art and science. As we add more neocortex in a nonbiological form, we can expect ever higher qualitative levels of abstraction.

British mathematician Irvin J. Good, a colleague of Alan Turing’s, wrote in 1965 that “the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.” He defined such a machine as one that could surpass the “intellectual activities of any man however clever” and concluded that “since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion.’”
