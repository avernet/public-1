# Introduction

- origin: far back into antiquity
- v: "The piano keyboard, for instance, derives directly from that of the Graeco-Roman organ, and the position of the
  hands on that primitive manual probably contributed in no small measure to the evolution of polyphonic music."
  #keyboard
- invented by engineer
- invention not gradual: inventor Alexandrian Greek Ktesibios
    - true creator of the instrument
    - keyboard with springs #keyboard
- "hydraulic instrument" is a confusing term
- scientific approach to historical research
- previous works
    - Hero of Alexandria
    - Vitruvius (De Architectura)
    - … skipping other works …
- reconstitutions
- definitions
    - "organum" means instrument (tool)
    - terms are confusing
    - historical misconceptions
    - examples: Old Testament; St. Augustine got it; funny illumination of musician hanging an organ up a tree
    - what it is since 3rd century
        - one or more ranks of sounding pipes
        - a wind-chest to store air
        - a mechanical blower, either a pump or a bellows
        - a keyboard to direct the air into the various pipes #keyboard
    - Instruments that are not "organs" per our definition
        - syrinx, bagpipe, Chinese sheng (no keyboard), accordion (no pipes)
        - maybe: Jewish magrephab, but fairly late instrument


# Part One: The organ in the ancient world

## 1. The invention of the organ

### The Alexandrian background

- fruit of the Greek science in Alexandria
- Alexandria became center of learning with Ptolemy Philadelphus, 283 BC
- Museum and Great Library (up to 500,000 manuscripts later)
- who's Who of Greek science lived there
- Plato: concepts more interesting than phenomena
- Aristotle and later: more interest in observation
- 4: "Euclid's Division of the Canon" and Ptolemy's Harmonics established that the pitch of a note is a function of the number of the oscillations made by the vibrating part."
- Ktesibios the engineer
- 4: "It is remarkable that experimental science, whose prospects were so bright, should have disappeared so quickly, and remained in abeyance for so long: and it is particularly surprising that the practically minded Romans did not take advantage of this new and positive aspect of scientific thought."
- influence of the Platonists

### Who invented the organ?

- 5: "Great inventions are said never to be the work of one man, and for this reason people have refused to acknowledge that the organ might have been conceived and created by a single person. And yet the texts establish that this is indeed what happened."
- 5: "in its original form the musical part of the instrument was very small in relation to the mechanical part"
- 5: "Only one ancient text, The Learned Banquet (Deipnosophistes), offers any information relating to the invention of the organ."
    - by Athenaeus
    - "'There is nothing of value', says the introduction, 'to which the author does not make some reference in the course of the book'." :)
    - dialogue on the invention of the organ (Alcides & Uplian of Tyre)
    - hydraulis / hydraulic organ
    - text a bit uncertain, interesting nonetheless

- Pliny the Elder mentions Ktesibios, for his theories on pneumatics and invention of hydraulic machines
- it is unlikely that Plato knew the organ
- Vitruvius (born c. 80–70 BC, died after c. 15 BC)
    - also mentions Ktesibios and accepts him as inventor
    - explains the theory of the hydraulis
- 10: "Thus the writings of the technical experts of Antiquity agree in attributing the invention of the new musical instrument to a real historical person, Ktesibios."

### Where and when Ktesibios lived

- Ktesibios: not a common name, but it appears in a few places
- obscure origins
- native of Alexandria
- little doubt the engineer is a single person
- must have been adult around 270 BC

### The character and reputation of Ktesibios

- Vitruvius gives an account of Ktesibios's early life
- son of a barber
- Vitruvius full of admiration
- Ktesibios describes his inventions in a book called *Commentaries* which is now lost, but was known to Vitruvius
- Ktesibios is generally praised by writers of the antiquity

### Philo of Byzantium and Hero of Alexandria

- Philo
    - different from Philo of Athens
    - could have been pupil of Ktesibios, but unknown fact
    - describes hydraulis as "a syrinx that is played it was the hands"
    - *Treatise on engineering*
    - Praises Ktesibios for having discovered properties of compressed air
    - 18: Philo "demonstrates the existence of air as a material substance, a bold concept for his day"
- Hero
    - source for Vitruvius
    - detailed description of the hydraulic organ
    - pneumatics, etc.
    - describes advanced appliances including with air, water but even steam
    - acknowledges Philo
    - machines are relatively small, and in the Roman Empire a manual labor was plentiful and cheap
    - famous
    - wide range of possible dates
    - he knew Latin
    - accepted view: first century A.D.
    - never mentions Ktesibios, but might be implicit (K. was the "master", but not directly)
    - "We may assume that the essence of Ktesibios's knowledge and skill is present in the work of Hero of Alexandria."

## 2. The hydraulic organ (I)

### Preliminary inventions

- Q: why would Ktesibios invent a new musical instrument?
- 23: "Music was much practiced in Alexandria"
- there were other musical automata, including by Ktesibios
- but existing wind mechanisms had disadvantages
- bellows were known for a long time
- Ktesibios had already invented a pump
- Philo: "He [Ktesibios] had proved, in the pneumatic theorems discussed above, that air is resistant, elastic, and extremely mobile."
- double-barreled fire pump "capable of raising water to a great height"
- before that, pumps made of skin bladders filled with water
- with Ktesibios's pump, the water did not go directly through the pistons, instead air in box pushed water
- with the hydraulis, the idea was that "Instead of moving the water by means of compressed air, he had the idea of compressing the air by the weight of the water."
- two conditions had to be met:
   - build sufficient pressure to crate to supply of air
   - maintain that pressure at more or less constant level
    - Ktesibios had already build a toy automaton doing that
- result is a "powerful and entirely original type of wind mechanism with which to feed a musical instrument whose sound potential might be practically unlimited"
- then idea of the wind-chest, and manual
- unclear whether in Ktesibios's time instrument went beyond prototype
- his wife said to be playing it
- but the potential realized in the Roman world
- detailed analysis of the mechanism are from Hero and Vitruvius

### Hero's description

![Hero's Organ](images/Hero's Organ 600.png)

- his text is clear and precise
- apparent that the author is an experienced engineer
- copyists errors
- follows the description of Hero's organ's blowing mechanism
- "pnigeus" is the hemisphere at the bottom ("oven", "damper" other meanings), about 60 cm diameter
- "platysmation" inlet valve in air pump
- one big omission: the machine lacks an outlet valve
- pedestal about 1 m tall, 80 cm diameter
- piston pump
- cylinder about 50 cm, diameter 30 cm
- description of the wind-chest
- description of the keyboard #keyboard
    - drawers slide into the wind-chest under each pipe
    - cranks around the median axis, able to push the sliders in
    - horn spatulas act as springs, connected w/ gut to the sliders
- only one rank of pipes, but by the first century BC, the system of stops was invented
- conjecture that to reduce air leaks, grease or maybe thin leather might having applied
- Hero doesn't describe the compass, tuning, lips, or fitting of the pipes
    - engineer, not musician!
- Hero follow the description with the windmill activated organ, which seems impractical, and likely not from Ktesibios

![Hero's Pneumatics manuscript](images/Hero's Pneumatics manuscript 600.jpg)

### Vitruvius's description

![Vitruvius's Organ](images/Vitruvius's Organ 600.png)

- Architect Vitruvius
- knows more music then hero
- Devotes a whole chapter to the theory of Greek music
- long and sometimes obscured description of the hydraulic organ
- instrument is more sophisticated than that of Hero
    - two pumps
    - more efficient valves
    - improved type of wind-chest, can feed up to eight sets of pipes
    - seems like a real instruments, Ktesibios's organ appears more experimental
- Marcus Vitruvius Pollio
- has long been held that he lived around the time of Augustus
- some opinions place him centuries later
    - say his style was bad
    - but Vitruvius was an engineer
- more recent research seems to confirm the Augustus period
- 36: "Vitruvius is […] obviously describing in detail an instrument he has seen with his own eyes."

- description by Vitruvius has all the important details
- blowing mechanism
    - 2 pumps, make for more even sound probably
    - "dolphins" and "cymbals" as intake valves
        - dolphin makes sense as instrument uses water
        - supposed to have taste for music
        - probably that not all instrument has dolphins
- wind-chest and manual
    - several ranks of pipes
    - probably invention of another, unknown Greek engineer
    - valves instead of modern draw-stops
    - sliders have n holes, as many as there are ranks of pipes
    - iron springs
    - 41: "The text contains no description of the manual with keys."
- 42: "From the positions shown in the illustrations, it is absolutely certain that he played with both hands, and was
  thus able to execute relatively quick passages with a wide variety of rhythms."

## 3. The Graeco-Roman Organ: the Evidence of the Texts

### To the middle of the first century A.D.

- besides Hero and Vitruvius, references to the organ are incidental
- summary
    - Ktesibios: 2nd 1/2 of 3rd century B.C.
    - wife Thaïs first organist
    - a few decades later, one generation or two at most, Philo of Byzantium
- we don't know if the instrument was cultivated right away, or if it was just a curiosity
- likely that it progressively grew
- 150 years after Ktesibios, inscription of Delphi
    - 90 B.C.
    - mentions Antipatros, hydraulis player
    - won 2-day competition
    - implies hydraulis well known
- 50 years later, Cicero
    - implies music of hydraulic organ a subtle pleasure
    - 1st piece of Latin evidence for existence of organ
- *Aetna* poem (Virgil's?)
    - reference of organ in "great theatres"
    - might imply organist was pumping himself, maybe w/ feet
    - also describes hydraulic sirens

- starting middle of the first century A.D., hydraulic organ is a familiar instrument
- popular in Rome, theaters
- Nero amateur
- possible that the instruments was brought to Rome from Greece by Nero himself
- also possible that the organ in the amphitheater was used to provide rhythm to the gladiators

### The second century A.D.

- organ is part of life in the Roman world
- hydraulis has numerous sets of pipes timbres and notes

### The first appearance of the bellows organ

- today confusingly known as the pneumatic organ
- 51: "Who had the idea of replacing the pistons and the water cistern by simple bellows – and when was this first done?"
- no evidence that this was before the hydraulic organ
- possibility to add bellows instead of the manual pumps, in fact this existed as shown by Arab text
- but other approach is to eliminate water completely
- benefits
    - lighter, easier to move
    - can also be used in private houses
    - less expensive
    - less worries about leaks, rust, or frost
- hydraulis
    - more complex, so more likely to be discussed and praised
    - also relatively mysterious role of the water
- 52: "The interest stirred up by the hydraulis was largely due to the complexity of its mechanism and the mysterious
  role of the water, which aroused the admiration of scholars and baffled everyone else. But there was no magic about
  the pneumatic organ."
- drawbacks
    - harder to control pressure
    - therefore smaller instruments until later times
- clearly instruments by the second century
- Julius Pollus briefly describe two types of instruments, one with a smaller sound, and one was a bigger sound
- blacksmiths were already using bellows
- experiments seem to show that leaks in the wind-chest with sliders, bellows are incapable of supplying even small
  organs with enough air
- author "convinced that the Roman pneumatic organ must have had some kind of regulating device"

### The third century A.D.

- 3 texts between the end of the second in the first half of the third century
- show that the organ was popular and very widely distributed
- 54: Athenaeus of Nauratis tells us that at that time "the inhabitants of Alexandria were proud of the fact that their
  city had been the birthplace of the organ"
- text by Porphyry of Tyre (233-303)
    - mentions how the length of the pipes of the aulos creates various intervals
    - "hydra": shortcut for hydraulis, and/or reference to the tentacled monster?
- one text from Rhodes implies liturgical role, which is exceptional for the time ("player of the water organ charged
  with awakening the God")

### The fourth century A.D.

- strange text from the beginning of the fourth century by Porfyrius Optatianus
    - laid out as musical instrument, including an organ
    - first time the term "organ" appears in the precise and limited sense of organ
    - from the fourth century on, impossible to know just by the term "organum" whether pneumatic or hydraulic instrument
    - "Placed beneath these comes a line of square-shaped keys whereby the musician's hand opens and shuts in time the
      openings for the air" #keyboard
    - "able to follow the opened keys, which ever tremble to the slightest touch" #keyboard
    - text to Constantine, Who we might conclude was able to appreciate this
- Julian the Apostate (332-63) clearly describes a pneumatic instrument
    - 59: "And a proud man with nimble fingers stands there manipulating the keys which give voice to the pipes." #keyboard
    - pneumatic, but large instrument, organist plays in a standing position
    - imply that the keys respond instantly to any pressure #keyboard
- Claudian (c. 400)
    - "Let him whose light touch draws forth mighty sounds"
    - at most about 50 pipes by then based on iconography
    - "Apparently it was the organist himself who operated the bellows handle, presumably with his feet"
    - organ used for the atmosphere of great occasions, recitals
- other text mentions a great wedding
    - mentions "wet" organ
    - surprising, this implies water, but specifically says that they are bellows
    - most likely is that it is a hybrid instrument
    - by that time, many people still regarded instrumental music as something rather degrading
    - by middle of the fourth century "organs were built on a larger scale than before"
    - unclear whether more pipes, or longer pipes with lower pitch (latter more likely)
- St. Augustine says that the term "organum" applies to all (organ) instruments
- several emperors besides Nero interested in music and the organ

### The fifth and sixth centuries A.D.

- Theodoret of Cyrrhus (387-450)
    - symbolism linking the organ was the tongue
    - at Antioch, bellows organ seems to have completely supplanted the hydraulic organ
    - bellows worked with the feet, like harmonium
- hydraulis as a mobile instrument
- not much material due to the great invasions and destructions that followed
- Theodoric the Great has some interest in the organ

- Senator Cassiodorus (middle of 6th century)
    - mentions "wooden keys" #keyboard
    - describes organ able to produce "very loud sounds as well as soft sweet ones"

    - end of the 4th century
    - organist of Roman legion
    - he and his wife were organists
    - hypothesis: to accompany gladiators
- couple more inscriptions

## 4. The Graeco-Roman Organ: Iconographical Evidence

- texts explain how things work
- pictorial representations are important, because they show outward appearance
- about 40 illustrations of organs
- mainly the hydraulic organ, unchanged from Vitruvius to the disintegration of the Western Empire
- much less frequent bellows organs
    - had less impact on the public
- media: bas-relief on sarcophagi, funeral steles, ivory; statuettes; mosaics; gem-stones, medallions
- pumps, levers, blowers often left out
- author convinced that in some cases the organist used feet to pump the air
- archaeological relics: small organs of Pompeii, pneumatic organ of Aquincum
- we know very little about the manual, since it is nearly always out of sight in iconography #keyboard

### The organ with orchestra and human figures

#### 1. Nennig mosaic

- Found in 1852
- about 16 x 20 m

- this is the wind-chest with the pipes implanted
- 27 or 28 pipes very tightly together
- organist behind instruments, head and shoulders rising above the pipes
- hands should have come halfway up the tallest pipe
    - but unlikely, keys would need 25 cm tall parts
    - probably due to artist doing from memory
- instrument slightly more than 2 m tall, longest pipe 80 cm, smallest 60
- artist careless, but fine instrument
- played with the horn, probably for a gladiatorial combat

- complete mystery
- special type of organs if they are organs in fact

### The organ in the Aquincum museum

- discovered in 1931
- not a hydraulic organ

- but metal parts have been recovered
- third century organ (228)
- 4 sets of 13 pipes
- wind-chest made of wood, but inside and out lined w/ sheets of bronze
- manual #keyboard

### Musical theory and notation

- 118: "The ancients regarded the octave of a consonance, but they never accorded it the fundamental role that it has today"
- Pythogoras
    - basic unit is tetrachord (perfect 4th)
    - division of vibrating strings into simple fractions
    - 1/2 -> octave
    - 2/3 -> 5th
    - 3/4 -> 4th
    - series of 5ths w/ 7 strings
    - bring them back to a single octave
    - Pythagorean scale
- Aristoxenian scale
    - 1/2, 2/3, 3/4
     - diff between 4th and 5th: 8/9
     - simplifies Pyth. scale
 - tone = diff between 5th and 4th
     - widely used in Middle Ages to tune organ pipes
     - divided into 2 semitones or hemitones
     - 1/2 hemitone = enharmonic diesis
 - Greater Perfect Disjunct System
    - 4 tetrachords
    - tetrachord Hyperbolaion
    - tetrachord Diezeugmenon
    - tetrachord Meson
    - tetrachord Hypaton
    - + bottom note Proslambanomenos
    - disjunct because tetrachord Meson and tetrachord Diezeugmenon don't share a note
- Lesser Perfect Conjunct System
    - 3 tetrachords
    - tetrachord Synemmnon
- no names of notes repeating octave to octave
- instead names defined by function of notes in tetrachord
- 2 middle notes of tetrachord can "move" e.g. a semitone
    - diatonic genus: tone - tone - semitone
    - chromatic genus: 1 1/2 tone - semitone - semitone
    - enharmonic genus: 2 tones - 1/4 tone - 1/4 tone
    - diatonic/chromatic popular, enharmonic fell after 5th c. BCE
- rhythm
    - very important
    - 10 rhythmic formulaes
- "modes" are controversial
    - might not have really existed
    - "harmonies" "must communicate a particular passion or character"
- tropes or tones
    - "define the respective pitch of the various systems within the scale of sound"
- notation
    - for composers and teachers, not musicians
    - letters, != if instrumental vs. vocal
    - upper signs for voice, lower signs for instrument

### The status of music

- hard to determine
- Plato and his school:
    - music more of a science than an art
    - mind must have precedence over the ear
    - Aristotle recognizes the physical pleasure of music, but only for adults
    - professional musician is inferior, like the artisan
- these are not beliefs of the man in the street
- all the most popular songs came from Alexandria
- in the days of Cicero, leading Romans would not have played in public
- but by the time of Nero, things changed

### Musical instruments

- popularity of aulos grew during the Alexandrian era
- syrinx or panpipe
    - lends its shape to the musical part of the organ
    - very ancient origin
    - found among a wide range of people
    - pipes stopped w/ wax -> can be tuned
    - 7 to 12 pipes
    - read or hemlock, but also bronze or ivory
    - usually very small (10 cm), but also up to 40 to 50 cm
- aulos
    - Very widely used in the Graeco-Roman world
    - vibrating reed, similar to the oboe
    - movable mouthpiece
    - holes for playing
    - the reed "Is the most delicate part of the whole instrument, and the utmost care was taken in its manufacture"
    - nearly always double, 1 instrument in each hand, mixing high notes and lower notes
    - initially 4 holes, 1 for each finger
    - then ferrules freeing fingers by continuing to stop corresponding holes
     - greater range of notes, multiple modes of the same aulos
     - single aulos -> Dorian mode, Phrygian mode, and Lydian mode
     - unlikely that early organ did not have the same possibilities
     - different auloi for different pitches
     - require the agility and also lung power
     - pleasant, captivating sound
     - solo, but also to accompany singing or choruses, also combined with cithara or other aulos
     - also flute
 - question of diaphony in antiquity
    - any true form of music in 2 parts?
    - "Practice of accompanying a melody was notes foreign to that  melody is certainly a very ancient one."
    - Plato was condemning the practice
    - likely that accompaniment was often improvised
    - probably a certain style of vertical polyphony
    - all these considerations apply to the organ
    - organ by nature polyphonic Instrument
    - 1932, Canon Mathias: "From the first, organ-playing was polyphonic… Besides, we have only two picture to ourselves an
      intelligent man faced with so many pipes, and so many keys unlocking the musical treasures of these pipes. It would
      be against all human reason and ingenuity not at least to try and play with both hands simultaneously, particularly
      since the way had long since been prepared for this by playing the bagpipes, which produced a perfect heterophony."
    - might be extreme, but iconographical evidence shows organists in most cases with both hands on the manual #keyboard
    - "Either he was playing in parallel octaves or 12ths, or else – and this is the most likely hypothesis – he was
      playing his own accompaniment to the melody he had to interpret, like the tibicen with his two pipes." #keyboard

## 7. The Graeco-Roman Organ: the Pipes and their Tuning

- very little that is known about the sounding part of the organ in antiquity
- historian is reduced to hypothesis
- in antiquity manufacturing processes were not considered as important as today
- such matters were left to the artisan
- no reference on the number of pipes
- iconography, but it is depending on whether artists have been faithful to the models
- based on representations
    - 8 pipes is the most frequent
    - 7, 9 and 10
- tessitura of the manual is more arbitrary #keyboard
- no illustration shows an instruments with a pipe 4x the height of another one
- British Museum: 3x
    - possibly, the Greater Perfect Disjunct System minus it's final tetrachord
- Tarsus terracotta: ~3x
- Carthaginian lamp
    - implies quarter tones
    - other representations also imply this
- small organs
    - ratio of about 3/2 -> a fifth
    - intervals ~ semitones
- Aquincum
    - ~ 1 octave
    - simplest division is semitones
    - remains hypothetical
    - might have allowed Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes (by approximation)
- Bellermann's Anonymous
    - author says that wind instruments more often use the Phrygian mode
    - but then says that hydraulis plays only: Hyperlydian, Hyperiastian, Lydian, Phrygian, Hypolydian, and Hypophrygian
    - reveals confusion of modes vs. tropes
    - but unlikely that real organs were able to play all of them
    - instead, there were various types of organs
    - or notes belonging to the six tropes within the confines of a single octave
    - possibly what's Aquincum pneumatic organ had
    - there is a measure of uncertainty about this anonymous text, also might be local
- "Illustrative evidence reveals that the Hydraulis embraces a somewhat restricted number of tetrachords."
    - 138: "A nucleus of "fixed" notes […] probably formed the framework of the melodic scale, and these, with the
      addition of certain "mobile" notes […] enabled the organist to perform in several tropes, thus introducing a
      little variety into his playing."
    - it was probably enough to play in the diatonic genus, and possibly chromatic genus
    - variety could also be added by changing "systems" (Disjunct/Conjunct), tropes, and rhythms
- unlikely that the "nuances" (smaller intervals) could have been achieved
    - especially in amphitheater orchestra, probably playing easy to remember popular airs
- all these hypotheses are fragile
- 140: But "One thing is certain: in those days, as in our own times, no two instruments were exactly alike."
- little doubt that the palette of sound was extremely varied
- We can classify by:
    - number of pipes
    - register (high, medium, or low)
        - in general Relatively high (4' pipe at most)
    - compass of the manual and it's melodic progression
       -  diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic (earlier)

## 8. The Hydraulic Organ (2)

- this chapter: calculation and experiment
- author built full-scale hydraulic organ

### Some theoretical considerations

- principle: based on compressibility of air
    - Strato of Lampsacus synthesized ideas of Democritus and Aristotle
    - Philo also mentions this
    - Archimedes
- Ktesibios compressor: supply air at constant pressure
- just a cistern w/ water
    - P = SH
    - pr = H
- pressure inside of pnigeus full of air
    - does not depend on shape of pnigeus, surface or shapes
    - depends on diff in level of water
- principle of Archimedes
    - pressure equals volume displaced
- what happens when pumps stop, and wind-chest consumes air?
    - water falls in cistern
    - rises in pnigeus
    - pressure decreases
    - minimize pressure decrease
        - cistern and pnigeus should be large enough
        - cistern should be filled to neck of pnigeus

### The hydraulis reconstructed

- follow Vitruvius
- manual: follow Hero #keyboard
- appearance: Carthage terracotta
- used simple tools, primitive materials
- Vitruvius: "not a word is said on how the keys were articulated, how they were joined to the sliders, or what was the
  shape of the spring" #keyboard
- followed Aquincum organ #keybaord
- some details of the reconstruction
    - […]
    - manual #keyboard
        - 15 "angle brackets", 10 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm
        - pivot at angle
        - face the sliders
        - leather strips to pull sliders
        - springs at back of sliders
    - 3 sets of pipes
    - semitones
    - trebles to the right, like on most illustrations
    - pumps can be run by 10-12 yo kids
    - 1 pump ok for 1 rank of pipes / 7-8 degrees compass
    - sound fairly steady but blowers must adjust rate on demand
    - 3 sets together -> unpleasant vibrato
    - "The manipulation of the keyboard is relatively smooth, and allows for some rapid passages. It is as easy as
      playing a classical organ without the Barker action, the only inconvenience being the spacing of the keys, for the
      keys must lie directly beneath the corresponding pipe." #keyboard
    - spacing of keys: 7 cm #keyboard
    - not enough water -> gurgling noise
    - very loud
    - difficulties: pumps, air tightness, leather, humidity

## 9. The Graeco-Roman Organ: a Synthesis

- Most existing evidence points toThe hydraulic organ
- Dibello's organ is elected
Hypothesis
    "Hydraulic organ virtually disappeared with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west"
    Nobody in the east Interested in documenting the pneumatic organ
    Bellows organIn a wide range of sizes
    Hydraulic organ seems to have very littleIn proportions

### The hydraulic organ

- 180 to 2 m in height, rarely more or less
- from 1 m to 1.2 m across
- probably more than 200 kg
- base made of solid wood, sometimes rectangular and generally hexagonal, 10 to 20 cm
- gives cistern a solid base
- cistern
    - made of brass
    - prism with a hexagonal base
    - can be rectangular, rarely cylindrical
    - decorated with motifs
    - decorations probably applied to a wooden casing enclosing it
    - might be possible to dispense with the casing in some cases
    - deeper then it is wide, from 0.8 m to 1 m deep, diameter 0.6 m to 0.8 m, capacity around 100 liters
- pumps
    - always 2 represented
    - 20 cm x 45 cm, up to 10 l of air
    - leather and oil to prevent leaks
    - piston rod made of iron, rarely shown
- air ducts
    - above or underneath the cylinders
    - we don't know much about the outlets valves
- pnigeus
    - hemispherical, or round funnel
    - probably lead or lead alloy, so that it doesn't rust
    - probably fixed the bottom of the sister
- arcula and stopcocks
- wind-chest
    - wide, flat box lying on top of the cistern and supporting the pipes
    - about 1 m to 1.2 m in length, 8 to 15 cm in depth
    - decorated front panel
    - case made of strong wood nailed together, probably glue to help prevent leaks
- manual #keyboard
    - virtually never appeared in the iconography
    - can be seen under Rusticus instrument
    - oblong shape
    - 158: "Aspect very similar to that of a modern instruments without its black keys"
    - also visible in the Carthaginian lamp, "with 18 oblong keys laid out in line with their respective pipes"
    - "The row of keys lies some 12 cm higher than the foot of the pipes; and if this is an accurate reproduction - as
      seems to be the case - then the angled keys have their horizontal leg pointing upwards. Thus the finger playing the
      note pushes the slider by pressing on it, and the spring brings it back; this procedure coincides with Vitruvius's
      description […]; and Hero indicates a similar device."
    - manual was high so that the organist could see the spectacle
    - metal used in making the plinthides, brass rods, oiled
    - keys were either of metal or wood, if latter reinforced with bronze strips
    - initially pulled back by horn spatulas, later by steel springs, or bronze
    - "Manual was played with the fingers"
    - "this called for real virtuosity: […] 'nimble fingers' […] 'straying' […] 'Masterly fingers' […] sliders
      'Continuously in motion'"
- pipes
    from 7 to 18 in each set
    - front row of pipes all in equal diameter
    - compass not to have exceeded a 12th
    - usually from 5th to octave
    - this applies to flue pipes, but reed pipes and stopped pipes remain outside of the scope
    - interval somewhere near the semitone, sometimes smaller maybe
    - variable number of stops, probably not more than 3 or 4
    - friction would have made made it harder to have longer sliders
    - we don't know how they were made or tuned
    - may have been rolled and soldered
    - in most cases, treble pipes to the right
    - author convinced that this goes back to the very origins of the organ, but is arbitrary
    - we don't know exactly how the pipes were held in place on the tabula summa
- timbres
    - 2 main categories of timbre
    - noisy reed pipes (probably mainly those in the amphitheater)
    - sweet flue pipes

### The bellows organ

- mentioned in the second century BCE
- probably existed before that
- ws probably a small instrument
- bellows known for a very long time (Homeric times)
- author belief "that pneumatic organ can only have begun to present a serious threat to the hydraulis when some unknown
  inventor devised the regulating bellows"
- regulator already known in the time of Augustus
- bellows simplify the system because they removed the need for water
- instrument also became lighter
- bellows organ were still described as "hydraulic organs "up to the Middle Ages, probably just as habit
- Byzantines only used the bellows organ

### The organ as a solo and orchestral instrument

- organ is essentially a solo instrument
- on occasion appears with other instruments or to accompany singing
- "gladiatorial fight without music was unthinkable"
- there was a precedent of using music and instruments for executions

### The organists

- professional organist was able performer
- "specialized manual technique in order to operate the keyboard" #keyboard
- required practice
- was probably tempted to add accompaniment to the melody, like double aulos
- played in a standing position propped by a small stool
- raised manual allowed following the course of event over the top of the pipes
- blowers are usually 2
- pumping bellows with the feet at least starting the first half of the fifth century
- might have happened earlier
- first organist was a woman, Ktesibios's wife
- "It appears that women was particularly ready to devote themselves to studying the organ"

# Part Two: The Organ in the Middle Ages

## 10. The organ in the Eastern empire

### The historical background

- beginning of 4th century, Roman Empire moves to the east with Constantine
- by the end of 5th century the Eastern Roman Empire had already assumed own characteristics
- music was important thing in Constantinople
- neglect of sciences, favor literary, oratorical arts and theology
- "Physics, chemistry, and applied mechanics appear to have been consistently disregarded."
- technique of organ building remained static
- however, service to history by copying, translating, and commenting upon lots of works from antiquity

### The Byzantine organ

- principal Byzantine writers on music are almost exclusively concerned with musical theory
- "It is to Constantinople that the modern world owes the survival and development the organ"
- disappeared in Western Europe, completely forgotten by the 8th century
- continues to be played in the East and remained popular
- secrets of its construction made their way back to the West long before the destruction of the Byzantine Empire
- instrument was part of the imperial pomp
- doesn't look like the organ found its way into the church
- 171: "the clergy, influenced by the Fathers, remained stubbornly opposed to all instrumental music. Only vocal music
  was tolerated in divine worship."
- hydraulis disappeared, only bellows organs
- in general or organs were bellows organs
- external aspect described by Harun ben-Jahja, 867
    - "al-urgana"
    - 60 copper pipes, each slightly taller than it's neighbor
    - bellows are inserted
    - 2 men apply to pumping
    - organists makes the pipes sing
- analysis
    - instruments can be moved
    - bellows are detachable, make it easier to move
    - bellows "primed" first, which seems to imply that there is a regulator
- reference by Al-Mas'udi (10th century)
    - urghanun
    - leather bellows
    - iron pipes

### The ceremonial use of the organ

- emperor-historian Constantine Porphyrogenitus (912-959) DeThat Ceremoniis
    - at Hagia Sophia
    - organists are to the left and right of the door
    - organ playing while the crowd is singing
    - indication that 2 organs were playing together
    - even indication that 3 instruments playing together
    - protocol dictates that organist must play short interludes at given moments
    - organs also carried to the Hippodrome
    - emperor's personal property was golden organs heard only on special occasions
    - Slavs to pump at the Hippodrome
    - organ also heard in other occasions in the streets of the capital
    - misconception that hydraulic organ was played the baths (poem by Leo Magister)

### Organs at the palace: the golden tree

- emperor's palace had organs and automata
- 2 great golden organs
- 2 silver organs of the two factions
- we can't know if it's the same organs that were taken out
- Emperor Theophilius (829-842) was passionately devoted to the organ
- built sumptuous golden organs for the palace
- "Music that is serene and full of charm"
- also constructed a golden pneumatic musical tree
- all destroyed by Theophilus's son Michael III, melted the organs into coins
- to be rebuilt later, Gilded bronze (seen in 931)

### Organists

- nothing known of Byzantine organists
- iconography: Obelisk of Theodosius
    - organists of the two factions
    - blowers are not shown
    - stabilizing bellows are visible, children as weight

### Appreciation of organ music

- we can conclude that organ music must have been very much appreciated
- texts report delight, therapeutic effects, or to prevent soldiers from falling asleep
- likely that there were two types of music
    - ceremonial and grandiose, w/ read pipes
    - more intimate style w/ flue pipes
- but mainly the purpose of the Byzantine courts was to "enhance the sacred majesty of the imperial palace"
- nothing known about tessitura of the Eastern organ

## 11. The organ in the Arab world

### The historical background

- evolution of organ in Islamic world of the 8th, 9th, and 10th century, is unclear
- probably more studying from a technical point of view, less for pomp
- closing years of Umayyad dynasty (660-750)
    - Muslim empire had whitest territorial limits
    - productivity arts and architecture
    - but little progress and sciences
- Abbasids (750-1258)
    - Empire no longer united
    - but most splendid period
    - 2nd 1/2 of 8th century and 1st 1/2 of 9th
    - court of Baghdad
    - literature, the arts, and the sciences were cultivated
    - spirit of research and discovery
    - state encouraged study
    - al Ma'mun founded "House of science" in Baghdad
    - advances in astronomy, chemistry, medicine, mathematics
    - translations
    - also curiosity about music

### The organ presented to Shih Tsu

- Avicenna (10th century) knew of the organ
- not many mentions by Arab writers, and they seem to be mostly by people haven't seen the instrument
- in the 12th century, organs were manufactured in Damascus
- 14th century Chinese document mentions that between 1260 and 1264, organ was sent to Emperor Shih Tsu [Kublai, Yuán Shìzǔ] By the
  "Muslim kingdom"
    - 90 pipes Of purple bamboo
    - 15 ranks times 6
    - about 5 ft high, 3 ft wide
    - it appears that Chinese retuned the instrument to their taste
    - richly decorated
    - unclear how it was operated

### Muristus and pseudo-Jerome

- hybrid hydraulic organ Described by one Muristus
- unclear when he lived, if at all; first references mid-9th century

|----------|--------|-------------|
|2013-11-16| 35 mn  | pp. 191-204 |

- some theories on Muristus
- adapted from earlier works, revised, corrected
- probably from Baghdad
- 2 instruments, not organs in modern sense
    - 1 activated by breath of 4 men, 12 pipes
        - precise description w/ 3 animal skins
        - similarities to organ, but very different
    - 2 type of syren
        - "heard 60 miles"
        - "Great Organ
        - uses water like hydraulic organ
        - "pnigeus" aboug 6.5 m in height!
        - "the men who blow should moreover have their ears stopped with cotton covered with wax, so they do not swoon
           or lose their hearing"
        - one supposedly built for a "King of the Inner Franks"
- other text mentions organ make of 2 elephant hides sewn together, 12 bronze pipes

### Musical automata

- following principles of Ktesibios, Philo, Hero
- water-powered "flute"
- possibly contrived by Archimedes
- musical tree in Caliph Al-Muqtadir's Baghdad palace (917 CE)
- disadvantage: air stops once tank is full
- more advanced automata
    - 2 reservoirs, filling and emptying alternatively w/ valves
    - rotating cogs to open/close holes on flute
- summary
    - organ did not evolve much in Damascus / Baghdad
    - evolved towards automata
    - real tradition of organ preserved in Syria
    - Byzantium organ tradition was lost: courts / palaces haven't used the organ since
    - organ will find way to churches of the West, and mostly disappear from secular use

## 12. The organ in Western Europe from the eighth to the tenth centuries

- historically interesting to the musicologist
- because of curious circumstances surrounding its reappearance in Western Europe
- great invasions erased the Graeco-Roman hydraulis from memory
- middle of 8th century, Byzantine organ arrived in France
- instrument became known again
- for 3 centuries after fall of Rome, no substitute for Rome's authority
- intellectual life practically disappeared
- little or no activity in the arts, with exception of music, in monasteries
- religious vocal music blossomed (Gregorian chant)
- Pope Gregory the first (6th century)
- later Pepin, Charlemagne sent cantors to Rome to improve their art
- schools of religious music were established in Gaul (Aix-la-Chapelle, Metz, St. Gall)
- monks became interested in the making of instruments
- when the organ appeared in Europe it was reproduced
- 2 treatises on organ building are the work of ordinary monks
- not many documents
- word organum is ambiguous

### The return of the organ

- beginning of the Carolingian era
- dramatic reentry into Western Europe
- "Came from Constantinople as a gift from the Emperor Constantine Copronymus to Pepin the Short, king of the Franks"
 - gift was for political design
     - Pepin king in 751
     - pope needed help from the Franks Because of Lombardy's threat
     - Rome was menaced
     - Pope Stephen II had to turn to the Franks
     - Pepin delivered Rome and turned Lombardy to the pope
     - Emperor was unable to respond so used diplomatic maneuvers
     - so in 757 the organ arrived
 - impressed contemporary observers
 - Frankish chronicles of the time reports this as a highlights of the year 757
 - from chronicle: "an instrument never before seen in France"
 - memory of the Greco-Roman organ had been lost
 - no knowledge of the instrument itself
    - presumably was a Bellows organ made by Byzantine craftsmen
    - was well received
- text from St. Gall mentions an embassy from Constantinople in 812
    - describes instrument w/ cisterns and bellows of bull hide and bronze pipes
    - describes the sound of the instruments, varied from thunder to lyre to bells
    - but no other trace of this event, and it is likely a confusion
    - probably describes Pepin's organ
    - interesting though because it describes the sound of the instrument
    - the organ was for the palace, not for the church, exactly as in Byzantium

### Georgius the organ-builder

- 50 years later, second event marking the renaissance of the organ in the west
- arrival of the first organ builder at the court of Charlemagne's son
- likely that the organ of Pepin was still remembered
- the organ builder was immediately supplied with materials, workmen and funds
- Eginhard
    - "Annals"
    - "Translation of the Holy Martyrs Marcellinus and Peter"
    - priest of Venice, Georgius
    - "consummate skill"
- life of Louis the Pious
    - emperor received him joyfully
    -  was publicly thanked
- in 826 Louis the Pious was 48
- likely that Gregorius learned in Constantinople
- unclear if emperor summoned him or if he came on his own
- "we know that the Carolingians strove desperately to emulate the pomp of Constantinople"
    - poem by Ermold le Noir mentions that the organ was the last thing the Franks didn't have over Constantinople
      (hyperbole)
 - Walahfrid Strabo
    - organ played outside of the building (so probably not in the chapel)

### "Organum hydraulcum" in medieval texts

- "organum hydraulcum" must not mislead: no more hydraulis by 9th century
- author: Georgius built pneumatic organ
- there are references to the hydraulic organ, but they are "literary relics"
- some clearly misinformed references to how hydraulic organ worked

### The Church's attitude to the organ

- Georgius
    - 1st organ-builder in West for 5 centuries
    - passed knowledge to pupils who spread it
- Pepin and Louis the Pious organs were primarily secular
- but from here association w/ church
- hypothesis: only monks able to make and tune pipes (requires education)
- Georgius was priest, his pupils probably monks
- Church fathers: instrumental music is suspect
- Georgius's influence probably changed that
- organ progressively was tolerated, and then became in common use
- Baldric, Bishop of Dol, letter (early 12th century)
    - heard organ in a church
    - mentions, and condemns, jealousy from churches that don't have one
    - compares humans to organ pipes (should sound together)
    - thinks organs are good thing
    - Abbey of Fécamp had permanent organ in church
- St. Aelred, Abbot of Riévaulx in Yorkshire (1166)
    - condemns the organ
    - spectacle, pleasure
    - mentions noisy bellows
    - bells (cymbalum)

### The organ in the ninth and tenth centuries

- last quarter of 9th century: pupils of Georgius spread over Europe
- Pope John VIII (872-82) asks for an organ from Bavaria, for teaching music
- monk Ademar (998-1034) says that Charlemagne asked for 2 Roman musicians to come to France to train singers for "vocal organum"
- beginning of 10th century, appearance in monasteries and liturgical service
- 915: "for the celebration of divine worship"
- England
    - possibility that organ in England in 2nd 1/2 of 7th century, but no evidence
    - "monumental instrument" in 1st 1/2 of 10th century in Winchester
- France
    - organ building late 10th century
    - Gerbert organ-builder, worked in Italy?
    - could also have learned from the Arabs
    - might have built a hydraulis
- 953: organ might have been played in Cologne, but uncertain
- 972: organ played in Spain
- around that time treatises on measurement of organ pipes

## 13. Techniques in organ-building in the tenth and eleventh centuries

- 2treaties on organ-building survived
- more complete and precise and than treaties of hero and Vitruvius
- describe a rather clumsy mechanism though
- in some ways, construction is a step back from Vitruvius

### The organ at Winchester

- 966: literary description by monk Wulstan to bishop Elphege
    - two levels of bellows, total 26!
- powered by 70 strong men
- 400 pipes, 10 ranks of 40
- 40 sliders with holes
- unclear whether there are springs, or if the organist had to push back the keys
- 2 organists needed, sitting on same bench
- 2 manuals #keyboard
    - configuration also appear sin manuscripts and the Utrecht Psalter
- letters inscribed on each key/slider (in text, referred to as "alphabet") #keyboard
- organists were likely poorly trained
- hypothesis
    - each organist controls 20 keys
    - 1 the bass notes, the other the treble
    - would have required coordination
    - 7 notes in the scale, plus "lyric" semitones
    - with all semitones (unlikely), tessitura would have been > 3 octaves (not impossible)
- also refers to the fact that the instrument is very loud

### The treatises of Theolphilus and the anonymous of Berne

- Wulstan's poem is detailed, but not a treatise
- 2 treatises are addressed to craftsmen
- Theophilus: nothing known, but probably first half of the 11th century
    - purpose is to instruct how to make about how to make everything lacking in a church
- anonymous
    - kept in Bern (Cod. B 56)
    - not Swiss in origin
    - probably 11th-century

### Making the pipes

- Theophilus
    - describes tools and processes
    - copper, tin as solder

anonynous
    - all pipes have same diameter
- Aribo
- conclusions
    - "pure" copper (unclear)
    - thinness is surprising, maybe for economical reasons
    - either conical or cylindrical w/ conical foot (anonymous)
    - same diameter
    - tallest pipe: 4 ft
    - foot: 7cm
    - lower orifice: 1 cm
    - upper orifice: 2.5-3 cm
    - soldering, either rolled over or juxtaposed and joined w/ metal strip
    - mouthpieces w/ lips, as in Roman times
    - all lips on same line

### The wind-chest and manual #keyboard

- Theophilus
    - wood or copper
    - 7 or 8 sliders #keyboard
    - sliders pushed: holes blocked
    - slider pulled: holes open
    - pipes placed in holes
    - sliders have handles marked with letters
    - hole in each slider for nail, which prevents the slider from coming out
    - if copper, also sliders, covered with clay
    - lead poured over
- anonymous
    - hollow box, air duct coming down, fed on 4 sides with double bellows
    - using molten lead poured in too
    - trebles to the right of the organist
    - 5, 6, or "what you will" sliders #keyboard
    - horn spatula as spring
    - wooden key reinforced w/ iron spike, on iron rod
    - key depressed -> slider pushed
    - key released -> slider brought back
    - wooden keys marked with letters "twice over", A-G|A-H
- conclusions
    - no draw stops, maybe because of air leaks issues
    - stops reappeared in 14th century
    - Theophilus's sliders like Ktesibios's
    - copper one is cast in clay mould, molten lead makes relatively air-tight covering
    - anonymous: copper sheet opposite air duct to make pressure more even
    - keys like Hero's
    - 15 notes, 2 octaves

### The bellows and collector

- bellows not described, taken for granted
- ram skins
- iron tube
- wooden planks
- number is variable, 2, 4, even 26
- bellows could be noisy and distract from the music
- different from forge bellows to prevent air return
    - this is well described by Theophilus
- collector (conflatorium) leading to the wind-chest

### Siting the organ

- advice to position the bellows on the other side of a wall
- archway in the wall
- curtains to protect the instrument from dust
    - dust is the enemy of the mechanism
- not a proper organ loft
    - only the wind-chest and pipes were visible
    - the organist and blowers were hidden
    - very different presentation from the Graeco-Roman hydraulic organ

### Measuring and tuning the pipes

- 10th-century, even 9th-century treaties on pipe measurement
- origin of the treatises is uncertain
- principles probably passed from the Carolingian, Byzantine and Arab builders
- one way is to cut them according to the theoretical divisions Of the monochord
- Odo, from Touraine, Abbot of Cluny (927-942)
    - method of cutting the pipes to get the various notes
    - not accurate for pipes with lips
- very early that has been noted, and formulaes have been devised to fix it
    - manuscripts in Latin
    - Aribo (2nd 1/2 of 11th century): quite precise numbers
- in 1860, Cavaillé-Coll produced a formula
    - but in the 10th century already they had figured out something very similar
- Notker Labeo, St. Gall monk (d. 1022)
    - treaties on measurements
    - Old High German
    - first pipe approximately 90 cm
- Anonymous of Bern
    - diatonic genus
    - starts with shortest pipe, and adds 1/8 each
    - 5th pipe is a half as high again as the first, etc.
    - second rank is an octave higher
    - manual has seven keys

### Scales and tessitura

|Date      | Time   | Read        |

|2014-01-17| 30 mn  | pp. 261-276 |

- diatonic scales were played, given the tuning of pipes
- B-flat on each octave is standard
- with 2 octaves, the final C is added
- added also B natural and B-flat
- beginning 13th century, sometimes manuals with 3 or 4 octaves
    - however this had critics: did not match human voice, and very high notes were shrill
    - still 3 octaves usual in the 13th-century
- not too much information about stops
- Wulstan: 10 x 40, but exceptional
- talk about three sets of pipes
- Eberhard of Freising: octave plus double octave
- fifths, and even fourths, were possible

## 14. The organ in Western Europe from the eleventh to the thirteenth century

### The organ in the 11th and 12th centuries

- 2 treaties already discussed + handbooks on pipe measurements
- + authors talk about how instruments were installed in churches
- poem w/ syllables w/ letter corresponding to a key on a manual
- "chansons de gestes" also mention organs
- portative organs had also appeared in Europe
    - probably known by the Byzantines, if not the Romans
    - iconography shows them as early as the 10th-century
    - e.g. 2 ranks of 7 pipes

### The organ in the 13th century

- organ essentially instrument of religious worship
- also small portative organs for secular use
- church organs began to multiply, St. Thomas Aquinas himself supporting that
- positive instruments, halfway between the great church organs and the small portative organs
    - moved on wagon
    - 4 feet
    - could be used in certain religious ceremonies
- portative organs were accompanied by singing
    - 2 bass pipes were much longer, maybe "bourdons", no associated keys
- starting 12th-century, the Gothic style is introduced
    - buildings are bigger, therefore instruments must also become bigger
    - later in the 14th century we find the ingenious coupling device

### Aspects of performance

- if the instrument had a manual w/ springs, virtuosity possible
- organs w/ sliders less so, but could have 2 organist play at the same time
- on the positive, organist (monk) is always sitting down
- organ could be played solo, but also with singers
- sequences, tropes and hymns were accompanied

### The cymbalum

- organ also played in an ensemble with other instruments - viol, flute, syrinx, etc.
- cymbalum was particularly popular, based on iconography
- 7-8 bells, played with his 1-2 hammers
- gave its name to the organ stop "cymbale", mix of fifths and octaves

    - 7 positives
    - 15 portatives

## 16. The Organ and Organum

- cymbalum influenced organ w/ an organ stop
- organ itself lent his name to a particular style of vocal writing
- similarity between the new technique and music played on the organ
- music have been so far essentially monodic
- from the 7th century onwards, diaphony vs. symphony
    - 2 sounds are dissonant
- not until 9th century first real attempt at polyphony
- 2 innovations: the trope, and the organum
- terms "organum" or "discant" or "diaphony" apply to vocal polyphony of two or more strands
- 2 melodic lines
- organum appears in this sense at the beginning of the 10th century
- "vox principalis" and "vox organalis"
- "The two strands are in consonants at the octave, the fifth or the fourth, with passing notes on the second and third"
- demands skills, strict and logical rules
- organum could be played on the organ
- also attempt to imitate the sound of instruments
- has been customary for long time to play 2 parts on the organ, like w/ the auletus
- possible w/ manuals w/ springs
- organs w/ 2 ranks of pipes that sounded fundamental + octave can be seen as a primitive form of organum
- origin of 4th and 5th is controversial
- modern organ stops still have a 5th
- composition with 2 voices is sometimes called "duplum" or "purum"
- 3 parts, triplum organum", then "quadruplum organum"
- organum reached peak of its glory at the end of the 12th century and 13th
    - school of Notre Dame in Paris, Léonin, Pérotin
- Similar forms stemming from the organum: rondeau, motet, conductus, Later known as *Ars Antiqua*

## 17. Conclusion

- "the pipe organ, though a complicated and highly original machine, was conceived and constructed by one man"
- invention was from engineer
- inspired idea to replace the breath w/ artificial supply of air
- also invented a system of distribution w/ drawers and a manual keyboard
- prototype is described in detail in the Hero of Alexandria's book
- wind chest w/ stops was familiar to Vitruvius, and in common use by the time of Augustus
- improvements since then are secondary features
    bellows, weights, larger wind chest, more notes and timbres, electrification
- traveled from Egypt in a Greek milieu, to Constantinople, came back to the Frankish kingdom
- 293: "The most striking feature of the organ's history is its remarkable deterioration in the earlier Middle Ages"
    - goes back to pieces of wood glued together
    - smaller instruments
    - primitive manual w/ push/pull action
    - probably explained by ignorance of the treatises of Hero and Vitruvius, but also the poverty of the age
- what's remained constant is the admiration for the rich and rhythmic music of the pipe organ
- manual keyboard to demand of the special fingering technique
- 293: "The order of the pipes on the Winchest, bass pipes to the left and trebles to the right, has remained the same
  since the first documents from Hellenistic times"
- but instrument also helped stimulate new style of vocal writing, which rapidly led to polyphony
- likely that true polyphony was played on the organ
- this would mean that "the organ has been largely responsible for the development of polyphonic writing"
