## Introduction

- origin: far back into antiquity
- v: "The piano keyboard, for instance, derives directly from that of the Graeco-Roman organ, and the position of the hands on that primitive manual probably contributed in no small measure to the evolution of polyphonic music."
- invented by engineer
- invention not gradual: inventor Alexandrian Greek Ktesibios
    - true creator of the instrument
    - keyboard with springs
- "hydraulic instrument" is a confusing term
- scientific approach to historical research
- previous works
    - Hero of Alexandria
    - Vitruvius (De Architectura)
    - … skipping other works …
- reconstitutions
- definitions
    - "organum" means intrument (tool)
    - terms are confusing
    - historical misconceptions
    - examples: Old Testament; St. Augustine got it; funny illumination of musician hanging an organ up a tree
    - what it is since 3rd century
        - one or more ranks of sounding pipes
        - hey wind-chest to store air
        - a mechanical blower, either a pump or a bellows
        - a keyboard to direct the air into the various pipes
    - Instruments that are not "organs" per our definition
        - syrinx, bagpipe, Chinese sheng (no keyboard), accordion (no pipes)
        - maybe: Jewish magrephab, but fairly late instrument


## 1. The organ in the ancient world

### The invention of the organ

#### The Alexandrian background

- fruit of the Greek science in Alexandria
- Alexandria became center of learning with Ptolemy Philadelphus, 283 BC
- Museum and Great Library (up to 500,000 manuscripts later)
- who's Who of Greek science lived there
- Plato: concepts more interesting than phenomena
- Aristotle and later: more interest in observation
- 4: "Euclid's Division of the Canon" and Ptolemy's Harmonics established that the pitch of a note is a function of the number of the oscillations made by the vibrating part."
- Ktesibios the engineer
- 4: "It is remarkable that experimental science, whose prospects were so bright, should have disappeared so quickly, and remained in abeyance for so long: and it is particularly surprising that the practically minded Romans did not take advantage of this new and positive aspect of scientific thought."
- influence of the Platonists

#### Who invented the organ?

- 5: "Great inventions are said never to be the work of one man, and for this reason people have refused to acknowledge that the organ might have been conceived and created by a single person. And yet the texts establish that this is indeed what happened."
- 5: "in its original form the musical part of the instrument was very small in relation to the mechanical part"
- 5: "Only one ancient text, The Learned Banquet (Deipnosophistes), offers any information relating to the invention of the organ."
    - by Athenaeus
    - "'There is nothing of value', says the introduction, 'to which the author does not make some reference in the course of the book'." :)
    - dialogue on the invention of the organ (Alcides & Uplian of Tyre)
    - hydraulis / hydraulic organ
    - text a bit uncertain, interesting nonetheless

- Pliny the Elder mentions Ktesibios, for his theories on pneumatics and invention of hydraulic machines
- it is unlikely that Plato knew the organ
- Vitruvius (born c. 80–70 BC, died after c. 15 BC)
    - also mentions Ktesibios and accepts him as inventor
    - explains the theory of the hydraulis
- 10: "Thus the writings of the technical experts of Antiquity agree in attributing the invention of the new musical instrument to a real historical person, Ktesibios."

#### Where and when Ktesibios lived

- Ktesibios: not a common name, but it appears in a few places
- obscure origins
- native of Alexandria
- little doubt the engineer is a single person
- must have been adult around 270 BC

#### The character and reputation of Ktesibios

- Vitruvius gives an account of Ktesibios's early life
- son of a barber
- Vitruvius full of admiration
- Ktesibios describes his inventions in a book called *Commentaries* which is now lost, but was known to Vitruvius
- Ktesibios is generally praised by writers of the antiquity

#### Philo of Byzantium and Hero of Alexandria

- Philo
    - different from Philo of Athens
    - could have been pupil of Ktesibios, but unknown fact
    - describes hydraulis as "a syrinx that is played it was the hands"
    - *Treatise on engineering*
    - Praises Ktesibios for having discovered properties of compressed air
    - 18: Philo "demonstrates the existence of air as a material substance, a bold concept for his day"
- Hero
    - source for Vitruvius
    - detailed description of the hydraulic organ
    - pneumatics, etc.
    - describes advanced appliances including with air, water but even steam
    - acknowledges Philo
    - machines are relatively small, and in the Roman Empire a manual labor was plentiful and cheap
    - famous
    - wide range of possible dates
    - he knew Latin
    - accepted view: first century A.D.
    - never mentions Ktesibios, but might be implicit (K. was the "master", but not directly)
    - "We may assume that the essence of Ktesibios's knowledge and skill is present in the work of Hero of Alexandria."

## 2. The hydraulic organ (I)

### Preliminary inventions

- Q: why would Ktesibios invent a new musical instrument?
- 23: "Music was much practiced in Alexandria"
- there were other musical automata, including by Ktesibios
- but existing wind mechanisms had disadvantages
- bellows were known for a long time
- Ktesibios had already invented a pump
- Philo: "He [Ktesibios] had proved, in the pneumatic theorems discussed above, that air is resistant, elastic, and extremely mobile."
- double-barreled fire pump "capable of raising water to a great height"
- before that, pumps made of skin bladders filled with water
- with Ktesibios's pump, the water did not go directly through the pistons, instead air in box pushed water
- with the hydraulis, the idea was that "Instead of moving the water by means of compressed air, he had the idea of compressing the air by the weight of the water."
- two conditions had to be met:
   - build sufficient pressure to crate to supply of air
   - maintain that pressure at more or less constant level
    - Ktesibios had already build a toy automaton doing that
- result is a "powerful and entirely original type of wind mechanism with which to feed a musical instrument whose sound potential might be practically unlimited"
- then idea of the wind-chest, and manual
- unclear whether in Ktesibios's time instrument went beyond prototype
- his wife said to be playing it
- but the potential realized in the Roman world
- detailed analysis of the mechanism are from Hero and Vitruvius
