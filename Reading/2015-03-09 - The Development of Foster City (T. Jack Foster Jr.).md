> the reason that the land was vacant: that this land was formerly tidal marsh, that the levees that protected it from the Bay were built around 1900 and the drying out process which occurred over the intervening years as the land was put into cultivation only extended down a few feet, and below that was mud for a depth of 60 to 90 feet!

> One day, my Dad said to Bill Moore, of Dames & Moore, that he wanted a tour of the Bay area to see every bad example of construction on soft soil. We started one morning and spent the entire day driving around the Bay, stopping at several badly designed buildings that had failed as a result of differential settlement.

Highlight on Location 184-186 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:28:27 PM

> The land was behind levees –– the water that fell on it stayed on it until it evaporated. Clearly the land had to be drained. The most economical drainage solution involved placing a minimum of 18 million cubic yards of earth fill!

> A spokesman for the Sierra Club said in celebration of the creation of the BCDC, “We were too late to stop Foster City but we’ll see that there are no others.” He was only slightly wrong; the land which became Redwood Shores was “grandfathered” from the act as was Foster City.

> There were to be three neighborhood convenience centers, all located on the lagoon, plus another small one near the eastern edge of the island, on the Bay. It was felt that the convenience centers on the lagoon could be designed in a manner that would allow shopping by boat, which set them apart from the ordinary neighborhood center.

> How big should the typical lot be? 55' x 100'? 60' x 100'? 65' x 100'? The standard finally adopted was 65' x 95'. The curvature of the shoreline determined by the layout of the lagoon dictated that the streets would be curvilinear.

---

Highlight on Location 352-354 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:44:00 PM

> Lots located on the shore of the lagoon would be the most valuable, so consideration was given to how to maximize this type of land. This was done by the creation of the islands. With a lagoon of four miles in length, the addition of islands enabled us to have thirteen miles of shoreline.

---

Highlight on Location 355-358 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:44:46 PM

> The Foster City islands are connected by a strip of land. Rather than making the “strip” wide enough to have lots fronting the street, we chose to keep it narrow with views of the lagoon on both sides. The goal was that this entrance to the island be like a bridge. A culvert had to be put under that strip to avoid trapping stagnant water in the lagoon. We added several feet of fill to the strip, creating a hill of sorts, in order to enhance the bridge feeling.

---

Highlight on Location 362-364 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:45:32 PM

> To protect and stabilize the banks or shoreline of the lagoon, it was decided that the narrow waterways would be lined with concrete walls. The retaining wall is an inverted T with half of the cross bar of the T covered with earth and the other half on the floor of the lagoon. The wall is five feet high.

Highlight on Location 380-384 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:47:33 PM

> The earliest thinking envisioned a marina on Belmont Slough. the waterway that marked Foster City’s southern boundary and separated it from what became Redwood Shores. The July 1960 plan, “Brewer Island today—Foster City tomorrow,” showed a marina or yacht club with dockage in the Bay and also in the lagoon.

Highlight on Location 384-385 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:47:55 PM

> We thought that there might be demand for transfer of boats from one body of water to the other, and consideration was given to building a lock for that purpose.

---

Highlight on Location 386-389 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:48:24 PM

> Early on, the decision was made to allow only non-power boats in the lagoon; it was felt that the noise, and the waves created by their wakes would be objectionable. It would be better to make that decision at the outset rather than to try to implement it later, after the power boat advocates were established. Electric boats were excluded from the ban, as they are quiet and slow.

---

Highlight on Location 389-391 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:48:38 PM

> As we began to focus on the nature of the boating in the lagoon, the lock system was abandoned, feeling that whatever need there was to move boats from one marina to the other could be done by some system of cranes.

Highlight on Location 395-397 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:49:34 PM

> This July 1960 plan did not show a connection to Redwood Shores but did show a direct connection of a major arterial street from the Ralston/101 interchange, crossing Foster City in a big loop extending almost to the east shore, crossing Highway 92 and connecting to the end of Third Avenue.

---

Highlight on Location 398-400 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:51:12 PM

> That Foster City would have a connection to the land to the south, whenever it developed, was never in doubt and Foster City Blvd. seemed the logical place.

---

Highlight on Location 400-407 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:51:46 PM

> In time, as the later neighborhoods were designed, an alternate and better connection was envisioned at the end of Edgewater Blvd. in Neighborhood 8. As that street narrows, adequate right of way was preserved on both sides to allow future widening. Also, where the street ends, at Baffin, a right of way exists to allow extension of Edgewater Blvd. across what appears to be parkland. It aligns perfectly with Island Drive in Redwood Shores, so perfectly that it suggests that the planners there also anticipated a connection.   Frankly, while I know it would be a political hot potato, I earnestly believe that such a connection would be in the best interests of almost everybody, especially the residents of Foster City, commuting south. They now must drive north to Hillsdale Blvd. to get to Bayshore to then drive south. I think that it could save up to three miles on the commute for some. The relief on Bayshore would be so significant that the State Highway Department should insist upon it.

> We badly wanted to do something about the parade of electrical transmission lines crossing Foster City. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (P.G.&E) offered no help, as we investigated placing the lines underground. That proved impossible so we considered rerouting them around Foster City, offshore, on the Bay side.

---

Highlight on Location 410-412 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:53:23 PM

> The State master plan called for the Bay Front Freeway to be built from San Jose to San Francisco, in the Bay, on a combination of fill and causeways or bridges. It seemed logical to put the transmission towers in that location, between Foster City’s eastern shore and the freeway.

---

Highlight on Location 415-417 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:53:43 PM

> The question of putting the electrical and telephone distribution underground though was never in doubt. P.G.&E. at first said that it was not acceptable, that such a large system had never been built under ground. We said that it had to be done.

---

Highlight on Location 417-420 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:54:10 PM

> We hired an electrical engineer, Kenward S. Oliphant, to figure out how to do it. He presented a solution to P.G.&E. and they accepted it. Oliphant designed the entire underground distribution system for Foster City. It turned out that the transformer boxes had to be above ground, but we eliminated the most objectionable: the power poles and overhead wires.  

---

Highlight on Location 421-424 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:54:33 PM

> Some communities try to deal with this problem by putting the system on the rear lot lines where they are less obvious. With thirteen miles of lagoon shoreline in Foster City, where do the poles go? On the waterfront or the street? The Oliphant design became the standard used by P.G.&E. throughout their system.

Highlight on Location 463-466 | Added on Saturday, March 7, 2015 11:58:50 PM

> Later school boards decided that, with the number of high schools that it already had in the district, though poorly located in terms of distribution, a new high school in Foster City could not be justified and proceeded to divest itself of the 56 acre site, making Foster City the largest city in California without a high school.

---

Highlight on Location 480-483 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 12:00:15 AM

> Some of the ways that we hoped to give that “sense of place” to Foster City were frequent views of the lagoon, an occasional high rise building in view to allow orientation, lack of overhead wires with attendant poles, spacious arterial streets, and a family of street “furniture” that was attractive and unique to Foster City.

> The major supplier of fireplugs to cities and developments was Greenberg and Sons of San Francisco. Manufacturing as they did in San Francisco, they had the fire plug market for Northern California virtually tied up. Without shopping around, we asked them if they would consider designing a new look in fire plugs. They said yes, and asked us what we had in mind.   I said, “How about a plug that you could sit down on?”

> In the unincorporated areas of the County, the standard color for street name signs was green but for Foster City, we wanted to use blue in keeping with our water oriented theme. We asked Don Wilson, County Engineer, permission to deviate from the County standard and install blue signs. I think he was beginning to tire of acceding to our requests to be different, so he said “no,” so green it was. I was pleased to see that the City, in later years when it came time to change what had become the “old” signs, changed them to blue. It is a coincidence that the City chose the color that we wanted to use in the first place.

> In Neighborhood #1, there are lots backing up to Hillsdale Blvd. and a wall was needed to screen the back yards from the boulevard. Levorsen designed a row of reinforced concrete vertical slabs as the wall. Since there might be differential settlement along such a long length of wall, he staggered the placement of the slabs to allow a space between. By making them different heights, any settlement along the way would not show. They still stand and have been restored and painted by the City with new landscaping between the wall and the sidewalk.

Highlight on Location 533-536 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 9:54:58 AM

> If it is not rock, but gravel or sand or dirt, it must be capable of being compacted, that is, pressed together so as to make it like rock, with the moisture squeezed out. Bay mud, even if dried out so that it becomes dirt, is impossible to compact. If water is added, it becomes bay mud again whereas a proper fill, properly compacted, is undisturbed by moisture.  

---

Highlight on Location 537-538 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 9:55:15 AM

> It was impossible to compact the 60 feet deep bay mud. The answer was to place a layer of compacted fill on top of the existing bay mud.

---

Highlight on Location 539-542 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 9:56:20 AM

> The answer in that case would be to use piles. These are posts driven deep into the ground and the building placed on the posts. In some situations, piles are driven until they reach solid rock. In Foster City, however, they use “friction” piles which, at some depth are held in place by the pressure on the sides of the pile. The type of pile and its length depends on the weight of the building.

---

Highlight on Location 547-549 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 9:58:22 AM

> In another example, in Foster City, the bridges are on piles. The street pavement onto the bridge consists of a long slab of reinforced concrete with one end supported by the piles and the other end on grade As the land settles, the road remains connected to the bridge. There are many pile supported structures in Foster City—all successful.

> The original Wells Fargo Building, located at Hillsdale Blvd. and across Shell Blvd. from the present branch, posed an interesting design problem. Though a small two story building, it was required to have a vault. The vault would weigh much heavier than the rest of the building, and would cause the building to settle unevenly and toward the corner of the building where the vault was located.

Highlight on Location 557-559 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:04:27 AM

> Wilsey & Ham presented two different concepts: 1. raise the island enough for storm water to drain directly into the Bay and, 2. create a lagoon system to collect the storm water which could be pumped from the island, and raise the balance of the land high enough for the storm water to drain to the lagoon.

---

Highlight on Location 560-561 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:04:42 AM

> The second system amounted to an average fill depth of six feet. Dames & Moore allowed that as long as the fill was of a certain structural quality and compacted, that depth would be adequate.

---

Highlight on Location 563-564 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:05:19 AM

> The engineers had calculated that plan #1 would require 45 million cubic yards of fill while plan #2 needed 18 million cubic yards. With plan #1 the fill at the center of the island would be over fifty feet high.

---

Highlight on Location 565-566 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:06:27 AM

> Dames & Moore advised that such a depth of fill was impossible to achieve as the weight would cause the fill to simply sink into the mud, pushing out or up at some unknown point.

---

Highlight on Location 567-571 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:07:52 AM

> The calculation was made that the level of the city would sink, overall, by as much as two feet, the first one foot as soon as the fill was placed on it and the second foot over a period of years. This factor influenced the engineering design that followed. Streets had to drain after settlement and pipelines that depended on gravity, versus pumps, had to continue to flow in the same design direction.

---

Highlight on Location 572-575 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:08:39 AM

> the mud has a tendency to want to push back up if it can find a place of weakness. The engineers cautioned that the weight of the water in the lagoon is important in holding the mud in its place. If the lagoons were drained for some reason, there is danger that the mud in the channels could rise and the higher adjacent land could sink!

> Recognizing that basic feasibility hung in the balance, the Board of Supervisors, satisfied with the quality of engineering being presented by the two firms, voted unanimously to accept the saucer concept—plan #2. Engineer Wilson graciously accepted the decision of the Board, and continued to work with and cooperate with the developers in the ongoing development.

---

Highlight on Location 580-583 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:10:38 AM

> Wet fill is fill from under the Bay, capable of being transported by water. The belief was that wet fill would be cheaper and the filling operation would be less disruptive of the region. The first effort was a negotiation with Utah Construction Company, the large San Francisco company which owned some large dredges and had a record of successful completion of dredged fill operations, such as Alameda in the East Bay.

Highlight on Location 584-585 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:11:37 AM

> One problem was that there was no suitable material for fill in the Bay close to the island. The mud offshore had no structural quality and could not be used.

> There is no better fill than sand as it compacts easily and, when compacted, is structurally sound. This deposit was called San Bruno Shoals. We found that Estero Municipal Improvement District (more later) could lease this deposit with an agreement that paid a royalty to the State of 10 cents per cubic yard. The State got the added benefit of enlarging the Bay with the excavation.

Highlight on Location 590-592 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:13:10 AM

> This sand deposit was five miles from Brewer Island. Utah Construction Co. figured the job, including pumping the sand the entire five mile distance, plus the additional distance for it to reach across the island. Brewer Island is about two miles across. This is not an impossible task in the dredging business, but it proved to be much too expensive.

Highlight on Location 611-616 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:28:10 AM

> As we began to despair over finding an economical solution, we were approached by a small dredging company named Associated Dredging Company. They had a plan to use a small dredge to excavate the sand from San Bruno Shoals and put it into a barge which would then be brought to the edge of the island. The sand would be dumped under water, and then redredged onto the land, with a small dredge. This multiple handling of the fill seemed illogical, but with the ability to use small dredges pumping shorter distances, it made sense. Furthermore, the dredges were available as were two earth moving barges, with gates that allowed the release of sand into the water. The only problem was, the barges were in Utah; they had been specially built for a large fill project in the Great Salt Lake.

Highlight on Location 630-631 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:40:33 AM

> The mobilization for the fill operation began. The Estero District had negotiated for the purchase of the two barges. They were huge, big enough to carry 2,000 cubic yards of sand. That is equal to 120 double gondola truck loads.

> With cutting torches and cranes, the two barges were cut into as many parts as could be loaded onto 86 freight cars. They were brought by Southern Pacific to a shipyard in the East Bay where they were unloaded and reassembled.

---

Highlight on Location 636-639 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:41:51 AM

> In the reassembly there was a redesign to lower the superstructure of the barges. If this were not done, when returning empty at maximum height above the water and at high tide, the topmost part would not clear the old San Mateo-Hayward bridge, necessitating raising the lift section of the bridge several times a day. This was not good for operations, needless to say the public relations with the Highway 92 motorists.

> Then, a basin was dredged. A large wooden dry dock, acquired in the east Bay, was brought to the site and lowered into the basin. It was originally built for the purpose of raising boats out of the water, but here it was to remain submerged and become the underwater hopper to receive the fill. Pusher type tug boats maneuvered the large barges over the dry dock/hopper where the bottom gates of the barge were opened and the sand was allowed to fall out. It took two hours to load a barge, and one minute to empty it.

Highlight on Location 646-649 | Added on Sunday, March 8, 2015 10:48:36 AM

> There were pipes with openings affixed to the bottom of the dry dock/hopper, which were attached to a dredge line. A pump sucked the sand and transported it by water through lengthy pipelines onto the land. The pipeline over the land extended a distance of two miles at times.

As the area filled, a tractor ran back and forth over the new fill squeezing the water out. The water then went to the point where a pump got rid of it. Then the fill started at the next section without the need to move the water disposing pump. Squeezing the water out is how sand is compacted.

> The dredge water still had very fine sand in it Because this very fine material had little structural strength, an area had to be found to accommodate it, one that would not be needed for many years. It was pumped to a holding area to allow the grains to sink. The then clear water was pumped into the Bay. The area chosen was the acreage north of Third Ave., where the golf facility is currently located. This had been a very shallow area of about 123 acres which we owned and saw very little use for. Levees were created by excavation from the Bay, and the newly created land eventually became available for limited use.

In the summer the lagoon is allowed to fill for recreation and aesthetic purposes. In the winter, when rain is expected, the lagoon level is lowered by two feet to provide that emergency storage capacity. The City has complete control of the water level by opening gates at the south end and allowing the Bay water to enter and removing water at the north end with the pumps. It sometimes uses this feature to simply circulate the lagoon water.

In some cases, it was put in the lower areas of the island where the old sloughs used to be, then the compacted sand fill was put over it. However, we still could not build on that area of the old sloughs and had to put about four or five feet of additional fill on top of the lot for a few years, eventually to remove it for use. The weight of this “surcharge” material, as we called it, compressed the soil beneath to make it more equal to the surrounding ground. Even then, extra reinforcing was required for the concrete in the foundations of the houses on those lots, extra above the special foundations required on “normal” Foster City lots.

> The soils engineers were confident that liquefaction would not be a problem. Liquefaction is a phenomenon when loose wet sand is shaken by an earthquake in such a way that the sand sinks and the water comes to the top. The result is a piece of ground that appears damp, becomes a pool of water with an earthquake. The only sand in Foster City is the imported fill and the water was forced out of it as it was compacted. At the outset, prior to the placement of any fill, cores were drilled all over Foster City to determine what was underneath. There was no sand at any layer so no evidence that liquefaction had ever occurred before. With no sand, liquefaction would not have been possible. With compacted sand, it is not possible either.

Their report always included a map, in case there was any doubt about where the shores of the Bay were but their report always ignored the fact that Foster City was covered with compacted fill. On the map, it looked just as bad as the rest of the bad areas. They even had a map showing the areas around the Bay that could have liquefaction. On the Foster City map, they showed such spots scattered here and there, as if there was a difference. There clearly was no difference. If one part of Foster City was susceptible to liquefaction, it all was.

The F.H.A. asked the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers for an opinion. and the corps asked for a greater height. Factors influencing the calculation were the maximum lunar tide combined with a storm tide combined with wave run up.

The main factor is to check for erosion and to place rip-rap or rock on the outside to prevent wave erosion.
