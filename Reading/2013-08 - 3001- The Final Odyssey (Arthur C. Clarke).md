> Soon after the Braincap came into general use, some highly intelligent—and maximally zealous—bureaucrats realized that it had a unique potential as an early-warning system. During the setting-up process, when the new wearer was being mentally “calibrated,” it was possible to detect many forms of psychosis before they had a chance of becoming dangerous. Often this suggested the best therapy, but when no cure appeared possible the subject could be electronically tagged—or, in extreme cases, segregated from society.

> the inconceivable energy of the Zero Point Field (sometimes referred to as “quantum fluctuations” or “vacuum energy”) can ever be tapped, the impact upon our civilization will be incalculable. All present sources of power—oil, coal, nuclear, hydro, solar—would become obsolete, and so would many of our fears about environmental pollution. They would all be wrapped up in one big worry—heat pollution. All energy eventually degrades to heat, and if everyone had a few million kilowatts to play with, this planet would soon be heading the way of Venus—several hundred degrees in the shade.

> The concept of an “inertialess drive”—i.e., a propulsion system that acts on every atom of a body so that no strains are produced when it accelerates—was probably invented by the master of the “Space Opera,” E. E. Smith, in the 1930s. It is not as improbable as it sounds—because a gravitational field acts in precisely this manner.

> Today, of course, it seems ludicrous that we could have imagined giant space stations, orbiting Hilton Hotels, and expeditions to Jupiter as early as 2001. It is now difficult to realize that back in the 1960s there were serious plans for permanent Moon bases and Mars landings—by 1990! Indeed, in the CBS studio, immediately after the Apollo 11 launch, I heard the Vice President of the United States proclaim exuberantly: “Now we must go to Mars!”

> Finally, I would like to assure my many Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim friends that I am sincerely happy that the religion which Chance has given you has contributed to your peace of mind (and often, as Western medical science now reluctantly admits, to your physical well-being). Perhaps it is better to be un-sane and happy, than sane and un-happy. But it is best of all to be sane and happy.
