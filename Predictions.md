- 2013-09-16: A. V.: "No 40x CPU perf improvement between iPhone 5S to 6 years after its release."
	- 2007-06-29: Original iPhone release.
	- 2013-09-20: iPhone 5S release (just over 6 years later).
	- On 2013-09-10, Apple [announced the iPhone 5S](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/10/live-coverage-of-apples-2013-iphone-media-event/) and and claims "CPU is 40x faster than original iPhone, with half coming with jump between A6 and A7". 
	- It's almost certain that there will be devices called "iPhone" in 6 years. The question is: how do you measure performance improvements? On a per-core basis seems unfair. So some kind of reasonable benchmark, possibly using all the cores, should show a 40x performance improvement.
- 2013-07-20: O. T.: "Apple will be dead in 10 years."
	- What will "dead" mean? I will interpret it not as "out of business" as that seems impossible for a company of this size, but as "largely irrelevant". This means signficiant less relevant than in 2013. How does this translate in terms of market share or number of devices or services?
