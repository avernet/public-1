# Predictions

## Mine

- 2015-06-11: @ebruchez: "Now that Apple has announced the open sourcing of Swift, I predict that by the end of 2016 there will at least one popular server-side, async/event-driven platform a la Node.js but based on Swift. It will run on Linux and OS X."
- 2015-01-21: @ebruchez: "California will legalize marijuana before year 2020."
- 2015-01-09: @ebruchez: "At least one new fall 2015 iPhone model will have 2GB of RAM or more."
- 2014-12-29: @ebruchez: "During 2015, Apple will either open source or unequivocally announce that it will open source Swift." [2015-06-08: CORRECT PREDICTION!]
- 2014-09-30: @ebruchez: "In 1 year, 50% of smartphones sold in the US in the previous quarter will have screen sizes around 5.5 to 6 inches."
    - In other words, I am predicting that the larger form factors will gain a lot of traction quickly.
    - "Smartphone" means the device has a connection to a traditional cellular network (3G, LTE).
- 2014-06-11: @ebruchez, with @avernet, following [@gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/11/hillegass-objc): "In June 2015, one year after Apple's announcement, Swift will have overtaken Objective-C on github based on metrics by either of [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/category/programming-languages/) or [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/languages/compare)."
	- 2015-01-16: UPDATE: "Swift just jumped from number 68 to number 22 in [â€¦] RedMonk" ([Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/redmonk-swift/), [Redmonk](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/)). Ojbective-C is still in position 10 though, so I don't know if the prediction will come true.
- 2013-09-26: @ebruchez: "In 10 years, glasses with features identical to 2013 Google Glass (or better) will be indistinguishable from regular prescription eye glasses (except if social or legal requirements impose some identifying aspects)"
	- The main idea is that the technology for this will be there and that products will be on the market with that technology.

## Other people

- 2013-12-03: @avernet: "Amazon Prime Air won't be usable in 5 years at Thomas's place (for technological or cost reasons, including but not limited to FAA requirements or high initial cost)."
- 2013-09-16: @avernet: "No 40x CPU perf improvement between iPhone 5S to 6 years after its release."
	- 2007-06-29: Original iPhone release.
	- 2013-09-20: iPhone 5S release (just over 6 years later).
	- On 2013-09-10, Apple [announced the iPhone 5S](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/10/live-coverage-of-apples-2013-iphone-media-event/) and and claims "CPU is 40x faster than original iPhone, with half coming with jump between A6 and A7". 
	- [Geekbench](http://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks): 11.8x (1619 for the iPhone 5, 137 for the original iPhone)
	- NOTE: This is *not* about overall performance, although that is interesting, but about *CPU* performance.
	- It's almost certain that there will be devices called "iPhone" in 6 years. 
	- The question is: how do you measure performance improvements? On a per-core basis seems unfair. So some kind of reasonable benchmark, possibly using all the cores, should show a 40x performance improvement.
- 2013-07-20: @otazi: "Apple will be dead in 10 years."
	- What will "dead" mean? I will interpret it not as "out of business" as that seems impossible for a company of this size, but as "largely irrelevant". This means signficiant less relevant than in 2013. How does this translate in terms of market share or number of devices or services? Maybe we can set the bar at 5% market share, a suggested by @avernet.
