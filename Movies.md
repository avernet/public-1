# Movies I liked

Here is the [complete list](https://pinboard.in/u:ebruchez/t:movie+watched) of movies I have watched since some time in 2007 (updated on pinboard as I go).

## Documentaries

I really loved these documentaries about China:

- [China - A Century of Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/China-A-Century-Revolution-China-Century/dp/B00005RRID)
- [Chinese School (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176268/)

## Movies

- [2001: A Space Odyssey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)): *the* science-fiction movie, and my favorte. It's hard to say that it's the best of the genre because it is absolutely unique.
- [The Hunger Games (2012)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/): I loved this movie and that got me to read the trilogy.
